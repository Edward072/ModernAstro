    "## 3.1 Basic Optics\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Refraction and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "First telescope developed by Hans Lippershey in 1608 and Gallileo Gallilei was first to use one for astronomical viewing in 1609. In 1671, Isaax Newton make reflecting telescope which helps remove chromatic aberration common with lenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types are reflecting and refracting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflecting Telescope** uses a mirror to reflect light.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refracting Telescope** uses lens to refract light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods bend light to form an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refraction works by Snell's law described by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_1,\\theta_1$ are the refractive index for the first material and $n_2,\\theta_2$ are for the second material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index of refraction is both material dependent and wavelength dependent by $n_{\\lambda} = c/v_{\\lambda} $, where $v_{\\lambda} $ is the speed of light in that medium. The frequency of the wave remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lenses for refracting telescopes are formed from glass and are either converging or diverging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Converging lenses** focus the light to a certain point on the optical axis known as the **Focal Point** and the length from the lens to this point is called the **Focal length.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diverging Lenses** diverge the light away from the optical axis, thus the focal point is on the same side of the lens as the light. (Negative focal length vs positive for converging).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Lens Maker's Formula** gives the formula for finding the focal length of a lens by:\n",
    "$$f_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{n_{\\lambda}-1}\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 Focal Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "To record an image, a detector must be placed on the **Focal Plane** of the telescope (plane passing through focal point). On axis point sources of light will converge on the focal point while other sources will focus approiximately on a distance y above the axis by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f\\tan\\theta$$\n",
    "$$ y \\approx f\\theta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to plate scale $ \\frac{d\\theta}{dy} = \\frac{1}{f} $ which connects angular separation of objects in sky by their linear separation in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 Resolution and the Rayleigh Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fundamental limit to our ability to resolve two objects due to the defraction of the light. This is related to the single slit diffraction pattern produced by light passing through a slit of width *D*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any ray passing through an aperature (opening) can be though of as being associated with another ray separated by a distance D/2 and arriving at the same point. If they are half wavelength out of phase then destructive interferrence will occur which leads to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m=1,2,3...$ for the dark fringes due to destructive interferrence. This produces a series of concentric fringes known as the **Airy Disk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, two sources that are clsoe together will have diffrwaction fringes that overlap making it impossible to resolve. Considered unresolvable if max of one falls within minimum of the other. This is known as the **Rayleigh Criterion.** Assumign angular separation is small, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{min} = 1.22\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for a circular apperature of a telescope with diameter D observing a wavelength of $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground based telescopes rarely approach this due to atmospheric turbulence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.4 Aberrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Refracting telescopes suffere chromatic aberrations due to the wavelength dependent diffraction, which causes color fringing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aberrations can be caused by shape imperfetions of the lens or mirror as well. This is called spherical aberration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coma produces elongated images fo point sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astigamatism caused when different parts of mirror or lens converge at different focal points. Fixing this can cause other problems such as a cruvature field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.5 Image Brightness\n",
    "\n",
    "Determined by intensity of the collected light (number of light rays going into aperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also determined by the focal ratio of the telescope (how many light rays being imaged after they are spread apart by the aperature). This is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = f/D $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Illumination determines time needed to collect enough light to form image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Optical telescopes\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Refracting Telescopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use two lenes with two focal lengths ($f_{obj}$ for objective lens and $f_{eye}$ for eye piece lens). The **angular magnification** of the image for a refacting telescope can be determined using their ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m = \\frac{f_{obj}}{f_{eye}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Defects in the shape of the lens must be small, on the order of $\\approx \\lambda/20$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.2 Reflecting Telescope\n",
    "Replaces objective lens with a mirror that reflects the light into the eye piece instead of refracting. Requires much less precision since the light doesn't pass through the lens. A large mirror collects the light at the bottom while a secondary mirror near the top or middle focuses the light into the eye piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Newtonian Telescopes** have eyepice or detector far above the center of mass of the telescope which causes problems mechanically due to the torque.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cassegrain** Since the secondary mirror blocks a point near the center of the objective mirror, a hole can be put here where the secondary mirror can refelct light into eyepice in the bottom of the etelscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ritchey-Chretien** uses hyperbolic mirror instead of parabolic which gives a larger field of view and also elimnates off axis optical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instruments are too large, a series of mirrors reflect the light to a **Coude room** where they can be processed out of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shmidt-Cassegrain** uses a spheroidal primary mirror and corrective lenses to reduce aberrations and also has a wider field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.3 Adaptive Optics\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of rubber mirrors that can be moved to adapt and correct to the changing shape of wavefronts of light due to the atmosphere. To do this, monitors guide star that is near the object to guage the change in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.4 Space-Based Observatories\n",
    "\n",
    "Telescopes placed in space to remove the effects of the atmosphere. These are much more precise than ground based but are much more expensive to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.5 Electronic Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Photographic plates were used first by astronomers to save images from telescopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once CCD (chareg coupled device) were invented they dominated telescope imaging as they are nuch more efficient and can collect almost 100 percent of incident light. They work by collecting the electrons that are excieted due to a photon striking them into a collector and detecting them. Number of electrons collected in each pixel determines the brightness of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very bright objects require quick shudders to prevent pixels from saturating (electron collectors are full and thus cannot measure the image accurately anymore since there is little differences inbetween pixels.)\n"
