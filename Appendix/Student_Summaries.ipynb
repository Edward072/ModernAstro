    "#### 5.4.1 The Emission Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Interested in the net flow of energy, not the specific path. The intensity can be increased through emission. This change is $ dI_{\\lambda} $ is proprtional to the the distance $ ds $ and the density of the gas $ \\rho $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dI_{\\lambda} = j_{\\lambda} \\rho ds ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here, $ j_{\\lambda} $ is the **emission coefficient**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific intensity $ I_{\\lambda} $, changes as the photons are added. Combining the equations of absoption and emission gives the general result;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{\\lambda} = -\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho I_{\\lambda} ds + j_{\\lambda} \\rho ds $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.2 The Source Function and the Transfer Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the ratio of emission to absorption ( $ j_{\\lambda} / \\kappa_{\\lambda} $ ), we cal this the **source function** $ S_{\\lambda} $ and looks like;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho} \\frac{dI_{\\lambda}}{ds} = I_{\\lambda} - \\frac{j_{\\lambda}}{\\kappa_{\\lambda}} = I_{\\lambda} - S_{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ I_{\\lambda} > S_{\\lambda} $ then the intensity decreases with distance. If $ I_{\\lambda} < S_{\\lambda} $, then the intensity increases with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.3 The Special Case of Blackbody Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a blackbody, the intensity is equal to the Planck function ( $ I_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda} = S_{\\lambda} $ ) [for something in thermodynamic equalibrium which stars are not in!]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying the transfer equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_{\\lambda}(s) = I_{\\lambda,o} e^{-\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho ds} + S_{\\lambda} ( 1 - e^{-\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho ds} ) $$\n",

    "A gray atmosphere is an atmosphere that has little to no wavelength dependence. The transfer equation for a gray atmosphere is;\n",

    "\n",
    "Absorption spectral lines are identified on graphs of the radiant flux $ F_{\\lambda} $ as a function of the wavelength $ \\lambda $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full width half maximum** (think inverse bell curve and take the half of the lowest point on either side and make a rectangle to connect these two with the max point of the inverse bell curve.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.2 Proccess that Broaden Spectral Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Natural Broadening: the spectral lines cannot be sharp even for motionless, isolated atoms due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2 \\pi c}  \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_0} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_f} \\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\Delta t_0 \\text{ and } \\Delta t_f $ is the lifetime of the electron in the initial state and final state respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Doppler Broadening: The wavelengths of the absorbed or emitted light are Doppler-shifted nonrelativistically according to $ \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda = +- | v_r | / c $. The width of a Doppler broadened spectral line should be;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{2 \\lambda}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k T}{m}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pressure (and Collisional) Broadening: the atomic orbitals are perturbed by a collision with a neutral atom or a close encounter with the electric field of an ion. Statistical is pressure, individual collisions is collisional. To determin collisional pressue, we need to determine the average time between collisions $ \\Delta t_0 $, and the mean free path $ \\ell $. These are related through the following equation;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t_0 = \\frac{\\ell}{v} = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 k T}}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ m $ is the atom mass, $ \\sigma $ is the collisional cross-section, and $ n $ is the number of atoms. From the collisional pressure, we can determine the spectral line width broadening to be;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi c \\Delta t_0} \\approx \\frac{\\lambda^2 n \\sigma}{\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k T}{m}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral line width is proportional to $ n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.3 The Voigt Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The total line profile is called the **Voigt profile** and is due to the contributions of the Doppler and the damping things. Doppler contributes more for the center wavelengths whereas the damping profile is more towards the wings of the curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine $ N_0 $, which is the coloumn density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.4 The Curve of Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps determine the value of $ N_a $ (the number of atoms that have electrons in the proper orbital for absorbtion) and the abundance of elements in stellar atmospheres. The width **W** varies with $ N_a $ and therefore a log curve can be used to estimate the change in both quantities. Using the curve of growth, and a determined width, we can determine the number of absorbing atoms.\n"
