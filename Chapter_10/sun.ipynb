    "Our Sun is classified as a typical main-sequence star of spectral class G2, which contains mostly hydrogen $(X=0.74)$, some helium $(Y=0.24)$, and a little metal ($Z=0.02)$ by mass.  The composition has changed (evolved) over time because it has been converting hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain for most of its lifetime.  Even though the Sun is changing over time, we can still estimate its age using other bodies of the Solar System.  For example, radioactive dating of Moon rocks and meteorites indicate that they are ~4.57 Gyr old and the Sun would be *at least* as old as these rocks.  Since becoming a main-sequence star, the Sun's luminosity has increased by nearly 48% and its radius has increased by 15%, which lead to an increase a 2.7% increase in its effective temperature.  The effect of this luminosity increase on the Earth is unclear due to the Earth's time-varying ability to reflect light through its albedo (caused by surface water and ice).\n",

    "### The Present-Day Interior Structure of the Sun\n",
    "Using the current age of the Sun, a **solar model** must reproduce the current values of the central temperature, pressure, density, and composition.  A schematic of the Sun can be constructed, where an inner core produces the radiation through nuclear reactions, a middle layer transports the energy through radiation, and an outer atmosphere brings energy to the surface through convection cells of rising and sinking gas.  Using such a model, the hydrogen mass fraction $(X)$ *in the core* has decreased from 0.71 to 0.34 and the helium mass fraction increased from 0.27 to 0.64 over the Sun's lifetime.  *At the surface* the hydrogen mass fraction increased by 0.03, while the helium mass fraction decreased by 0.03.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution of the Sun's interior includes ongoing nucleosynthesis, surface convection, and elemental diffusion (settling of heavier elements).  The Sun's primary energy production comes from the [proton-proton (pp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain) chain, where $^3{\\rm He}$, or [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium) is an intermediate species in the reaction sequence.  Tritium can be produced and destroyed as part of the conversion of hydrogen into helium.  However, tritium is relatively more abundant at the top of the hydrogen-burning region where the temperature is lower.  At greater depths, the higher temperatures the destroy the tritium more often than it is created, resulting in a overall decrease in abundance.  The production of $^4{\\rm He}$ (stable helium) decreases and hydrogen increases slightly near 0.7 ${\\rm R_\\odot}$ due to the surface convection zone and elemental diffusion.  \n",
    "\n",

Even if the total energy liberated per kilogram of material $(\\epsilon)$ decreases steadily from the inside-out, then the largest contribution to the total luminosity will occur in a shell that contains a significant mass rather than at the center.  In the case of the current (middle-aged) Sun, the decrease in available hydrogen fuel at the center will also influence the location of the peak energy production.  The pressure and density can change rapidly with radius, which produces variations on the solar structure through conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium, ideal gas law, and the composition structure.\n",

The interior mass function can be determined through the integration of the density function over the Sun's volume (i.e., $M_r = \\int \\rho\\:dV$).  The energy generated in the interior has to be transported outwards, where a criterion for the onset of convection is that the temperature gradient becomes [superadiabatic](https://sites.northwestern.edu/sethstein/files/2017/06/convection-2c1sura.pdf), \n",

For a large temperature gradient, convection becomes the more efficient means of energy transport.  A rapid rise in $d\\ln P/ d\\ln T$ near the surface $(r>0.95\\:{\\rm R_\\odot})$ is due to the significant departure of the actual temperature gradient from an adiabatic one.\n",

    "Models of stellar structure and the derivation of fundamental physical principles have uncovered an enormous amount of information regarding the Sun's interior.  A complete and reasonable model needs to be consistent with evolutionary timescales and the global characteristics (e.g., mass, luminosity, radius, effective temperature, surface composition, and oscillation frequencies).  However there is one aspect of the Sun where the observations don't match the theoretical model, which is the abundance of lithium.  The observed lithium abundance is somewhat less than expected, which may imply that some adjustments (e.g., through convection, rotation, and/or mass loss) to the model are necessary."

    "### The Solar Neutrino Problem: A Detective Story Solved\n",
    "For decades, there was an inconsistency between the observations of the Sun and the model, where the solution resulting in an important new understanding of fundamental physics.  In 1970, Raymond  Davis began measuring the neutrino flux from the Sun.  His detector was located almost 1 mile below ground within a gold mine in Lead, South Dakota.  The neutrino has a very low cross section for interaction with other matter, which makes it difficult to detect.  *Like the eye of Sauron*, neutrinos penetrate where other particles cannot.  The detector was placed underground to lower the background noise and ensure that it was only measuring neutrinos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutrino detector contained ~100,000 gallons of cleaning fluid, ${\\rm C_2Cl_4}$ (tetrachloroethylene), because chlorine interacts with ${\\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}$ to produce ${\\rm ^{37}_{18}Ar}$ that has a half-life of 35 days,\n",

    "Unfortunately, this reaction is very rare (1:5000).  Every few months, Davis and his collaborators purged the accumulated argon and determined the number of argon atoms produced.  The capture rate was measured using the **solar neutrino unit**, where 1 SNU equals $10^{-36}$ reactions per target atom per second.  The tank contained $\\sim10^{30}$ ${\\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}$ atoms, which corresponds to 5.35 SNU if only 1 argon atom was produced each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Bahcall computed the anticipated capture rate of 7.9 SNU, while the actual data (taken between 1970 and 1994) yielded an average of $2.56 \\pm 0.16$ SNU.  About one-third of the expected yield.  Other experiments have confirmed the discrepancy including Japan's underground Super-Kamiokande observatory.  This observatory detects the **Cerenkov light** produced when neutrinos scatter electrons.  Through this measurement only half of the neutrinos are detected compared to the predictions from solar models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deficit of neutrinos suggested that either **(a)** some fundamental physical process in the solar model is incorrect or **(b)** something happens to the neutrinos in-transit (i.e., on their way from the Sun's core to the Earth).  The **Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein** (or MSW) effect involves transformation of neutrinos between the three types ($\\nu_\\mu$, $\\nu_\\tau$, and $\\nu_e$).  This idea is an extension of the *electroweak theory** fof particle physics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmation of this idea came in 1998 when Super-Kamiokande was used to detect *atmospheric neutrinos* produced in Earth's upper atmosphere.  Cosmic rays are capable of producing only electron and muon neutrinos.  Super-Kamiokande determined that the number of $\\nu_\\mu$ traveling upward was significantly reduced compared to those traveling downward, where the difference in numbers is in excellent agreement with the theory of neutrino mixing.  For neutrino mixing to occur, the neutrino could not be a massless particle and the experiment confirmed this as well.  After several decades the solar neutrino problem was resolved by a profound advance in our understanding of particle physics."

The base of the photosphere is somewhat arbitrary since photons because some photons originate from deep within the Sun ($\\tau_\\lambda \\gg 1$).  The optical depth from a given layer $\\tau_\\lambda$ can be estimated from an estimate of the fraction of photons that we receive from that layer (i.e., $\\tau_\\lambda = -\\ln\\left(I_\\lambda/I_{\\lambda,o}\\right)$).  For instance, if 1\\% of the photons from a given layer, then the optical depth is approximately 4.6.  The opacity and optical depth are wavelength-dependent, where the base of the photosphere is also wavelength dependent if it is defined in terms of the optical depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Given the arbitrariness of the definition, the photosphere's base is sometimes simply defined as 100 km below $s_1$, the level where the optical depth at 500 nm is unity:\n",

    "The gas temperature decreases to 4400 K at 525 km above $s_1$ $(\\tau_{500}=1)$ as we move upward from the base and through the solar photosphere.  The temperature minimum defines the top of the photosphere, where the temperature begins to rise above this point.  The photosphere is defined to be 625 km thick and the bulk resides above an optical depth equal to unity.  On average, the solar flus is emitted from and optical depth $\\tau = 2/3$ ([the Eddington approximation](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_9/stellar-atmospheres.html#the-eddington-approximation)), which leads to defining the effective temperature (for [Wien's law](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#the-connection-between-color-and-temperature)) at this depth.\n",

    "A source of opacity exists and is continuous across wavelength due in part to the $H^-$ ions in the photosphere.  Using the [Saha equation](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_8/classification-of-stellar-spectra.html#the-saha-equation), we can determine the ratio of $H^-$ ions to the neutral hydrogen atoms.  The abundance of H II $(H^-\\:{\\rm ions})$ in the Sun is actually quite low (1 in $10^7$ atoms), but it becomes important because neutral hydrogen is not capable of contributing significantly to the continuum.\n",

    "From Kirchoff's laws, the absorption lines are produced when there is a cooler gas between the observer and the bulk of the hot source (i.e., continuum-forming region).  In reality, the Fraunhofer lines are formed in the same layers where $H^-$ ions produce the continuum.  The center of an absorption line originates from the regions of lower optical depth (i.e., higher in the photosphere) where the gas is cooler because the opacity is greatest at the center of the line (i.e., more difficult to see deeper in the atmosphere).  Moving into the wings of the line, the opacity decreases and this implies that absorption is occurring at progressively deeper levels.  At wavelengths far from the central line, the absorption is negligible and the continuum is observed. "

    "#### Solar Granulation & Differential Rotation\n",
    "Observations of the photosphere show a patchwork of bright and dark regions evolve over time, where the dark regions can appear and then disappear.  The spatial extent of a region can be 700 km and have a lifetime for 5-10 minutes.  This structure is called **granulation** and represents the top portion of a convection zone protruding into the photosphere's base.  Granulation causes wiggles to appear in the absorption lines due to small Doppler shifts (400 m/s) from the convection cycle.  The brighter regions produce blueshifts (i.e., rising hot material) in the absorption lines while the darker regions are caused by redshifts (i.e., sinking cool material).  The lifetime of a granule is defined as the amount of time for a parcel to rise and fall the distance of one mixing length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption lines are used to measure the rotation rate of the Sun, where measurements are taken from the equator and then outward with increasing latitude.  By measuring Doppler shifts as a function of latitude, we find that the Sun rotates *differentially* meaning the rotation rate changes with latitude.  The rotation period at the equator is approximately 25 days, while it increases to 36 days at the poles.  The Sun's rotation also varies internally with radius.  Near the base of the convection zone, differing rotation rates converge into a region known as a [tachocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachocline).  The differing rotation rates produce a strong shear in the atmosphere, which can result in electric currents in the plasma that generate the Sun's magnetic field."

The light produced in the chromosphere indicates that the gas density drops dramatically (by a factor of $10^4$) and the temperature begins to increase with altitude, from 4400 K to 10,000 K.  The Boltzmann and Saha equations show that spectral lines can be produced in the low density and high temperature environment of the chromosphere (e.g., He II, Fe II, Si II, Cr II, and Ca II).\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain Fraunhofer lines appear as absorption lines in the visible and near-UV, where others begin to appear as emission lines at shorter (or much longer) wavelengths.  Kirchoff's laws suggest that a hot, low-density gas must be responsible for the emission lines.  The emission cannot occur deep within the Sun's interior because the Sun is optically thick and so the area of emission line production occurs elsewhere.  The strength of the continuum decreases rapidly at shorter and longer wavelengths (far from the peak at 500 nm).  Thus, emission lines produced far from the visible are not overwhelmed by the expected blackbody radiation."
