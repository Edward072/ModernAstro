    "Astronomers must generate computer models to deduce the detailed internal structure of stars, where these models mus be consistent with the known physical laws and agree with observable surface features.  Much of the theoretical foundation was understood in the first half of the 20th Century, it wasn't until the 1960s that computers were advanced enough to carry out all the calculations.  Although computer modeling and evolutions is a success, there are numerous questions that remain unanswered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical study of stellar structure shows that stars are dynamic objects that typically change over very slow timescales (compared to us mortals), but some events can be very rapid and dramatic.  Consider the observed energy output of the Sun, which is $3.839 \\times 10^{26}$ J of energy emitted per second.  This energy output would be sufficient to melt a column of ice with a square mile area and 1 AU thick in only 0.3 seconds (assuming 100% absorption efficiency).  Stars have a finite supply of energy, where they must eventually use up their fuel and die.  *Stellar evolution is the result of a constant fight against the relentless pull of gravity.*"
