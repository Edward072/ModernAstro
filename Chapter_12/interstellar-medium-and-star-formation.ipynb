    "### The Interstellar Medium\n",
    "The evolution of stars is a cyclic process, where a star is born out of gas and dust that exists between the stars (i.e., **interstellar medium** or ISM).  During a star's lifetime, much of that material may return to the ISM through stellar winds or explosive events.  The next generation of stars can then form from the ashes, which are processed by the nuclear fusion within the deep interiors of stars.  Thus it's important to study the nature of the ISM so that we can better understand stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISM is an enormous and complex environment that provides a laboratory for testing our basic understanding of astrophysics (i.e., its the testbed to develop sensible initial conditions for stellar models).  The ISM interacts with the stellar environment through shocks and galactic magnetic fields that extend into interstellar space.  As a result, modeling the ISM requires detailed modeling of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations."

    "### Interstellar Extinction\n",

These dark regions are not devoid of stars, but the intervening dust blocks the background starlight.  Dust that blocks starlight is due to the combined effet of scattering and absorption, which is called **interstellar extinction**.  The apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright a star appears and if it is dimmed by intervening dust, the distance modulus equation must be modified appropriately.  In a given wavelength band centered on $\\lambda$, we have\n",

A single proton can have a kinetic energy ranging from $10^1-10^{14}\\,{\\rm MeV}$.  The highest energy cosmic rays are extremely rare, but energies from $10^3-10^8\\,{\\rm MeV}$ are common.  The sources of cosmic rays include stellar flares and supernova explosions.\n",

    "When an atom or molecule is ionized, the ejected electron carries some of the original kinetic energy with it.  The ejected electron, interacts with the ISM to increase the average kinetic energy of the ISM via collisions with molecules.  Those molecules then collide with other molecules, thereby distributing the thermal kinetic energy throughout the cloud and raising the temperature of the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sources of heating include the ionization of carbon atoms by UV photons, the photoelectric ejection of electrons from dust grains via UV, the absorption of light energy into the lattice of dust grains, and the ionization of hydrogen by stellar X-rays.  Shocks from supernovae or strong stellar winds can also produce some heating of molecular clouds in special cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To balance the heating processes, cooling mechanisms must also be in operation.  The primary mechanism for cooling is through the emission of IR photons because the IR photons can escape the molecular cloud more easily (i.e., Mie scattering) than shorter wavelength photons.  IR photons are produced in molecular clouds through collisions between ions, atoms, molecules, and dust grains.  Typically a collision results in excitation, where the energy of the excited state decays back to the ground state through the emission of an IR photon.  For example,\n",

    "The free-fall time is actually *independent* of the initial radius of the sphere.  AS long as the original density of the spherical molecular cloud was uniform, all parts of the cloud will take the same amount of time to collapse and the density will increase at the same rate everywhere.  This behavior is known as **homologous collapse**.  However, if the cloud is somewhat centrally condensed when the collapse begins, the free-fall time will be shorter for material near the center compared to material farther out (i.e., $t_{\\rm ff} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho_o}$).  As the collapse progresses, the density will increase more rapidly near the center than in the other regions and in this case, the collapse is known as **inside-out collapse**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Equation 20 is transcendental and cannot be solved explicitly.  But, numerical root finding techniques can be used.  The collapse is slow initially and accelerates as $t_{\\rm ff}$ is approached.  At the same time, the density increases most rapidly during the final stages of collapse.\n",

    "### The Fragmentation of Collapsing Clouds\n",
    "The masses of large molecular clouds could exceed the Jeans limit, which seems to imply that stars can form with very large masses (possibly up to the initial mass of the cloud).  However, observations show that this does not happen.  It appears that stars frequently tend to form in groups, ranging from binary star systems to clusters that contain hundreds of thousands of members.  Some clouds break into segments through a process called **fragmentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consequence of the collapse is that the density of the cloud increases by many orders of magnitude during free-fall.  Since the temperature $T$ remains nearly constant throughout the collapse, it appears that the Jeans mass must decrease.  After the collapse begins, any initial inhomogeneities in density will cause individual sections of the cloud to satisfy the Jeans mass limit independently and begin to collapse locally.  This cascading collapse could lead to the formation of smaller objects.  However, it is likely that only about 1% of the cloud actually forms stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What stops the fragmentation process?* The answer to this question lies in our implicit assumption that the collapse is isothermal, which in turn implies that the only that changes in the Jeans mass is the density.  Clearly this cannot be the case since stars have temperatures much larger than $10-100\\,{\\rm K}$. The other extreme is an *adiabatic* collapse, where the temperature must rise.  The real situation lies somewhere between these two limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an adiabatic process the gas pressure is related to its density by $\\gamma$ (the ratio of specific heats).  An adiabatic relation between density and temperature can be obtained (using the ideal gas law),\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "T = K^{\\prime\\prime}\\rho^{\\gamma -1}, \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K^{\\prime\\prime}$ is a constant.  Substituting into the equation for the Jeans mass (Eq. {eq}`Jeans_crit`), we find that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M_J \\propto \\rho^{(3\\gamma-4)/2}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "describes how the Jeans mass depends on density.  For atomic hydrogen ($\\gamma = 5/3$), the dependence simplifies to $M_J \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}$.  The Jeans mass *increases* with density for a perfectly adiabatic collapse of a cloud.  This behavior means the collapse results in a minimum fragment mass that can be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a crude estimate of the lower mass limit of the fragments using the virial theorem.  The energy released is roughly,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta E_g \\simeq \\frac{3}{10}\\frac{GM_J^2}{R_J} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for a spherical cloud just satisfying the Jeans criterion at some time during the collapse.  The luminosity due to gravity is given by \n",
    "\n",

The details of radiation transport was also neglected, as well as the vaporization of the dust grains, dissociation of molecules and ionization of the atoms.

    "To investigate the nature of gravitational collapse in detail, we must solve the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations numerically.  Although computing power has greatly increased, numerical models also make some simplifying assumptions to lessen the computational load and complexity of the output.  However, important aspects of the collapse still arise from the numerical solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider a spherical cloud of approximately $1\\,M_\\odot$ and solar compositions that is supercritical.**  Initially, the early stages of free-fall collapse are nearly isothermal because the absorption by the dust is relatively inefficient (i.e., photons have a significant mean free path).  An initial slight increase in density toward the center of the cloud produces a free-fall time that is shorter near the center and an inside-out collapse can begin.  When the density near the center reaches approximately $10^{-10}\\,{\\rm kg/m^3}$ (or $n \\sim \\times 10^{16}\\,{\\rm m^{-3}}$), the region becomes optically thick and the collapse becomes more adiabatic (i.e., heat becomes trapped).  The opacity at this point is primarily due to the dust.  After the cloud becomes more adiabatic, the gas pressure increases and slows the rate of collapse near the core.  The central region (radius of ~$5\\,{AU}$) is nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium and this central object is then referred to as a **protostar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observable consequence of the cloud becoming optically thick is that the gravitational potential energy released during the collapse is converted into heat and then radiated away in the IR.  By computing the luminosity (i.e., energy release rate) and the cloud radius (for an optical depth $\\tau = 2/3$), then the effective temperature can be determined via the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, and treating the dust as the photosphere.  After which, it becomes possible to plot the location of the simulated cloud on the H-R diagram as a function of time.  The curves on the H-R diagram depict the life histories of the simulated clouds are known as **evolutionary tracks**.  As the collapse continues to accelerate, the luminosity of the protostar increases along with its effective temperature.\n",

    "Above the developing protostellar core, material is still in free-fall.  Once that material meets the nearly hydrostatic core, a shock wave develops and the material is supersonic.  At this shock front, the infalling material loses a significant fraction of its kinetic energy in the form of heat and produces much of its luminosity.  When the temperature reaches ~1000 K, the dust begins to vaporize and the opacity drops.  This means the radius corresponding to an optical depth $\\tau = 2/3$ is reduced.  Since the luminosity remains high, a corresponding increase in the effective temperature must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrostatic core slowly increases as more overlying material continues to fall onto it.  Eventually, the temperatures becomes large enough to cause the molecular hydrogen to dissociate into atomic hydrogen.  This process absorbs energy that would otherwise provide a pressure gradient to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium.  The core becomes dynamically unstable and a second collapse begins.  After the core radius decreases to ~$1.3\\,R_\\odot$, hydrostatic equilibrium is re-established.  The core mass is still **accreting** gas, where the final mass will be larger.\n",

Given that dense cores have dimensions of ~$0.1\\,{\\rm pc}$, the initial radii of clouds undergoing protostellar collapse must be much smaller than traditionally assumed.  Also, the assumption of pressure-free protostellar collapse may also be incorrect, where more realistic calculations probably require an initial contraction that is quasi-static.\n",

Instead of the collapse of single protostellar clouds, the more massive stars may form through mergers of smaller stars in dense protostellar environments (a similar mechanism is proposed for the growth of supermassive black holes, SMBHs).

    "### The Effects of Massive Stars on Gas Clouds\n",
    "Through the formation of massive protostars, the temperature will begin to rise in the molecular cloud, where the dust will vaporize and molecules will dissociated before the star reaches the main sequence.  After reaching the main sequence, the surrounding gas will ionize, resulting tin the creation of a ${\\rm H\\,II}$ region inside of a ${\\rm H\\,I}$ region.  Due to the star's high luminosity, radiation pressure will begin to drive significant mass loss that can disperse the remainder of the cloud.  If several O and B stars form at the same time, then star formation can be halted around other protostars as they are starved for resources.  If the cloud was only marginally bound, the mass loss will result in the newly formed stars drifting apart from the initial cluster.  Some famous examples of this occurring are in the Carina Nebula (about 3000 pc from Earth) and in the [Eagle Nebula (M16)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/m16L.html).\n",

    "#### OB Associations\n",
    "Groups of stars that are dominated by O and B main-sequence stars are called **OB associations**, where studies show that they cannot remain gravitationally bound to on another due to their individual kinematic velocities and masses.  An example is in the Trapezium cluster in the Orion A complex, which is believed to be less than 10 million years old.  It is currently densely populated with stars $(>2000\\,{\\rm pc^{-3}})$ that are in the range of $0.5-2.0\\,M_\\odot$.  Radial velocity measurements (in $^{13}CO$) show that the gas in the vicinity is very turbulent, where the nearby O and B stars are dispersing the gas and causing the cluster to become unbound.\n",

    "#### T Tauri Stars\n",
    "There is a low-mass pre-main-sequence object that represents a transition from protostars still shrouded in dust and main-sequence stars, which is called a **T Tauri** star.  These objects are named after the first star of their class located in the constellation Taurus.  T Tauri stars are characterized by unusual spectral features and by large irregular luminosity variations (with timescales on the order of days).  The masses of T Tauri stars range from $0.2-2.0\\,M_\\odot$.  Many T Tauri stars also exhibit strong emission from hydrogen (i.e., the Balmer series) ${\\rm Ca\\,II}$ (H and K), iron, and lithium.  The forbidden lines $({\\rm O\\,I\\,and\\,S\\,II})$ are also present.  The existence of forbidden lines is an indication of extremely low gas densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information can be gleaned from spectra using the shapes of the lines as a function of wavelength.  In T Tauri stars, the ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ line often exhibits a characteristic shape, where an absorption trough (at the short-wavelength edge of the line) is superimposed on a rather broad emission peak.  This unique line shape is called a [P Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_Cygni) profile, which is named after the first star observed to have emission lines with a blueshifted absorption trough.  The existing of a P Cygni profile indicates that the star is losing mass significantly.  *From Kirchhoff's law, emission lines are produced by a hot, diffuse gas with little intervening material.*  In this case, the emission source is an expanding shell moving perpendicular to our line of sight.  *Absorption lines are the result of light passing through a cooler, diffuse gas.*  the mass loss rates of T Tauri stars average about $\\dot{M}= 10^{-8}\\,M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$.  In some extreme cases, T Tauri stars appear to accrete mass rather than lose it, where the P Cygni profile is inverted (redshifted absorption).  Mass accretion rates appear similar to mass loss rates.\n",

    "#### FU Orionis Stars\n",
    "A T Tauri star star can go through a significant increase in its mass accretion rate $(\\dot{M} = 10^{-4}\\,M_\\odot/{\\rm yr})$ and luminosity (by four orders of magnitudes or more) that lasts for decades.  The firs star to undergo these abrupt changes was FU Orionis, where similar behaving stars are called [FU Orionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FU_Orionis_star) stars.  Instabilities in a circumstellar accretion disk can result in $\\sim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$ being dumped onto the central star to cause the outburst.  The inner disk can outshine the central star by a factor of $100-1000$, while high-velocity winds $(>300\\,{\\rm km/s})$ occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Herbig Ae/Be Stars\n",
    "Closely related to the T Tauri stars are **Herbig Ae/Be stars**, named for George Herbig.  These pre-main-sequence A or B stars have strong emission lines (and hence the *e* designation).  Their masses range from $2-10\\,M_\\odot$ and tend to be shrouded in some remaining gas and dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Herbig-Haro Objects\n",
    "Mass loss during pre-main-sequence evolution can also occur from **jets** of gas that are ejected in narrow beams in opposite directions.  **Herbig-Haro objects** (HH objects) were discovered in the early 1950s by George Herbig and Guillermo Haro in the vicinity of the Orion nebula and are associated with the jets produced by young protostars (e.g., T Tauri stars).  Jets can excite gas within the ISM, which results in objects with bright emission line spectra.  Herbig-Haro objects HH 1 and HH 2 were created by material ejected at speeds of several 100 ${\\rm km/s}$ from a star shrouded in a cocoon of dust.\n",

The surfaces of a circumstellar disk are illuminated by the central star, which is hidden from view behind the dusty disk.  Jets are originating from deep within the accretion disk, possibly from the star.  These accretion disks appear responsible for emission lines, mass loss, jets and even some of the luminosity variations.  Unfortunately, the details are not fully understood, but early models can be developed.\n",

    "#### Circumstellar Disk Formation\n",

As the radius of the protostar decreases does its moment of inertia.  In the absence of external torques, the protostar's angular velocity must increase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A problem immediately arises when the effect of angular momentum is included in the collapse.  Conservation of angular momentum arguments suggest that all main sequence stars should be rotating very rapidly (at rates close to breakup).  However, this is generally not seen in observations, where the angular momentum must be transferred away from the collapsing star.  One suggestion is that magnetic fields slow the rotation by applying torques (i.e., magnetic braking).  Additionally, star-disk or star-planet interactions are likely to play a role in distributing the angular momentum."
