    "### The Interstellar Medium\n",
    "The evolution of stars is a cyclic process, where a star is born out of gas and dust that exists between the stars (i.e., **interstellar medium** or ISM).  During a star's lifetime, much of that material may return to the ISM through stellar winds or explosive events.  The next generation of stars can then form from the ashes, which are processed by the nuclear fusion within the deep interiors of stars.  Thus it's important to study the nature of the ISM so that we can better understand stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISM is an enormous and complex environment that provides a laboratory for testing our basic understanding of astrophysics (i.e., its the testbed to develop sensible initial conditions for stellar models).  The ISM interacts with the stellar environment through shocks and galactic magnetic fields that extend into interstellar space.  As a result, modeling the ISM requires detailed modeling of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations."

    "### Interstellar Extinction\n",
    "On a dark night (far from city lights), some of the dust clouds within the Milky Way Galaxy can be found because they obscure regions of sky that would otherwise be populated with stars.  These dark regions are not devoid of stars, but the intervening dust blocks the background starlight.  Dust that blocks starlight is due to the combined effet of scattering and absorption, which is called **interstellar extinction**.  The apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright a star appears and if it is dimmed by intervening dust, the distance modulus equation must be modified appropriately.  In a given wavelength band centered on $\\lambda$, we have\n",

    "\n",
    "which is a modified version of the distance modulus equation with a correction factor $A_\\lambda>0$ that adjusts for the interstellar extinction along the line of sight.  The extinction magnitude $A_\\lambda$ is positive because it always acts to dim objects along the magnitude scale.  If $A_\\lambda$ is large enough, a star can fall behind the limiting magnitude of the background sky for the naked eye or a telescope.  This is the cause for the dark bands running through the Milky Way.\n",

    "These limiting cases can be understood by analogy with the waves on the surface of a lake.  If the size of the surface waves (i.e., wavelength) is much larger than an object in their way, then the waves pass by almost completely unaffected $(\\sigma_\\lambda \\sim 0)$.  However, if the object (e.g., an island) is large compared to the waves, then they are simply blocked.  The only waves that pass by the large object are those that miss it altogether.  The light we detect from a dust cloud is the light that passes between the dust particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extinction magnitude $A_\\lambda$ is clearly wavelength-dependent, where longer wavelengths (redder light) are not scattered as strongly as shorter wavelengths (bluer light).  The starlight that passes through is preferentially red, or *reddened*, as the blue light is removed.  This **interstellar reddening** causes stars to appear redder, where we might infer them to be cooler through Wien's law.  Fortunately, we can carefully analyze the star's spectrum (i.e., absorption and emission lines) to detect the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongly scattered blue light can leave the cloud in any direction, where a bright star behind a cloud casts a blue **reflection nebula** for observers that are not along the line of sight (e.g., the Pleiades).  This process is analogous to Rayleigh scattering, which produces a blue sky on Earth.  The difference between Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering is that the scattering particles are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light in Rayleigh scattering and leads to $\\sigma_\\lambda \\propto \\lambda^{-4}$.\n",
