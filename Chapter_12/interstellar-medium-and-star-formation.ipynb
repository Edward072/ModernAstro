    "### The Interstellar Medium\n",
    "The evolution of stars is a cyclic process, where a star is born out of gas and dust that exists between the stars (i.e., **interstellar medium** or ISM).  During a star's lifetime, much of that material may return to the ISM through stellar winds or explosive events.  The next generation of stars can then form from the ashes, which are processed by the nuclear fusion within the deep interiors of stars.  Thus it's important to study the nature of the ISM so that we can better understand stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISM is an enormous and complex environment that provides a laboratory for testing our basic understanding of astrophysics (i.e., its the testbed to develop sensible initial conditions for stellar models).  The ISM interacts with the stellar environment through shocks and galactic magnetic fields that extend into interstellar space.  As a result, modeling the ISM requires detailed modeling of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations."

    "### Interstellar Extinction\n",
    "On a dark night (far from city lights), some of the dust clouds within the Milky Way Galaxy can be found because they obscure regions of sky that would otherwise be populated with stars.  These dark regions are not devoid of stars, but the intervening dust blocks the background starlight.  Dust that blocks starlight is due to the combined effet of scattering and absorption, which is called **interstellar extinction**.  The apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright a star appears and if it is dimmed by intervening dust, the distance modulus equation must be modified appropriately.  In a given wavelength band centered on $\\lambda$, we have\n",

The extinction magnitude $A_\\lambda$ is positive because it always acts to dim objects along the magnitude scale.  If $A_\\lambda$ is large enough, a star can fall behind the limiting magnitude of the background sky for the naked eye or a telescope.

A single proton can have a kinetic energy ranging from $10^1-10^{14}\\,{\\rm MeV}$.  The highest energy cosmic rays are extremely rare, but energies from$10^3-10^8\\,{\\rm MeV}$ are common.  The sources of cosmic rays include stellar flares and supernova explosions.\n",

Shocks from supernovae or strong stellar winds can also produce some heating of molecular clouds in special cases.  \n",

The primary mechanism for cooling is through the emission of IR photons because the IR photons can escape the molecular cloud more easily (i.e., Mie scattering) than shorter wavelength photons.

    "### The Fragmentation of Collapsing Clouds\n",
    "The masses of large molecular clouds could exceed the Jeans limit, which seems to imply that stars can form with very large masses (possibly up to the initial mass of the cloud).  However, observations show that this does not happen.  It appears that stars frequently tend to form in groups, ranging from binary star systems to clusters that contain hundreds of thousands of members.  Some clouds break into segments through a process called **fragmentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consequence of the collapse is that the density of the cloud increases by many orders of magnitude during free-fall.  Since the temperature $T$ remains nearly constant throughout the collapse, it appears that the Jeans mass must decrease.  After the collapse begins, any initial inhomogeneities in density will cause individual sections of the cloud to satisfy the Jeans mass limit independently and begin to collapse locally.  This cascading collapse could lead to the formation of smaller objects.  However, it is likely that only about 1% of the cloud actually forms stars.\n",

    "*What stops the fragmentation process?* The answer to this question lies in our implicit assumption that the collapse is isothermal, which in turn implies that the only that changes in the Jeans mass is the density.  Clearly this cannot be the case since stars have temperatures much larger than $10-100\\,{\\rm K}$. The other extreme is an *adiabatic* collapse, where the temperature must rise.  The real situation lies somewhere between these two limits.\n",

The details of radiation transport was also neglected, as well as the vaporization of the dust grains, dissociation of molecules and ionization of the atoms.

An initial slight increase in density toward the center of the cloud produces a free-fall time that is shorter near the center and an inside-out collapse can begin.  When the density near the center reaches approximately $10^{-10}\\,{\\rm kg/m^3}$ (or $n \\sim \\times 10^{16}\\,{\\rm m^{-3}}$), the region becomes optically thick and the collapse becomes more adiabatic (i.e., heat becomes trapped).  The opacity at this point is primarily due to the dust.  After the cloud becomes more adiabatic, the gas pressure increases and slows the rate of collapse near the core.  The central region (radius of ~$5\\,{AU}$) is nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium and this central object is then referred to as a **protostar**.\n",

    "An observable consequence of the cloud becoming optically thick is that the gravitational potential energy released during the collapse is converted into heat and then radiated away in the IR.  By computing the luminosity (i.e., energy release rate) and the cloud radius (for an optical depth $\\tau = 2/3$), then the effective temperature can be determined via the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, and treating the dust as the photosphere.  After which, it becomes possible to plot the location of the simulated cloud on the H-R diagram as a function of time.

At this shock front, the infalling material loses a significant fraction of its kinetic energy in the form of heat and produces much of its luminosity.  When the temperature reaches ~1000 K, the dust begins to vaporize and the opacity drops.  This means the radius corresponding to an optical depth $\\tau = 2/3$ is reduced.  Since the luminosity remains high, a corresponding increase in the effective temperature must occur.\n",

Given that dense cores have dimensions of ~$0.1\\,{\\rm pc}$, the initial radii of clouds undergoing protostellar collapse must be much smaller than traditionally assumed.  Also, the assumption of pressure-free protostellar collapse may also be incorrect, where more realistic calculations probably require an initial contraction that is quasi-static.\n",

    "Stars with masses greater than 10 $M_\\odot$, may form by a different process, which could be due to limiting feedback mechanisms, such as the high luminosity of ionizing radiation associated with high effective temperatures.  Instead of the collapse of single protostellar clouds, the more massive stars may form through mergers of smaller stars in dense protostellar environments (a similar mechanism is proposed for the growth of supermassive black holes, SMBHs).  The ionizing radiation problem could be moderated by an **accretion disk** that feeds the growing massive star through its infalling gas and dust."

One observational bias arises from the very different evolution rates for star in different mass ranges (i.e., the more massive stars have shorter lifetimes) and thus, it is not surprising that massive stars are extremely rare compared to low-mass stars.  Observations also suggest that the curve below $0.1\\,M_\\odot$ (or $\\log_{10}\\,m = -1$) may be fairly flat indicating a large number of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.\n",

    "### ${\\rm H\\,II}$ Regions\n",
    "Hot, massive stars (O and B spectral types) are shrouded in a cloak of gas and dust when they reach the ZAMS.  The bulk of their radiation is emitted in the UV, which can ionize the ground-state hydrogen gas $({\\rm H\\,I})$ in the ISM to produce ${\\rm H\\,II}$ regions.  The ${\\rm H\\,II}$ regions are in equilibrium if they have equal rates of ionization and recombination.  During recombination, the electron cascades downward and produces a number of lower-energy photons (many will be in the visible).  The dominant visible wavelength comes from the $n=3$ to $n=2$ transition, or the ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ line of the Balmer series.  Therefore, ${\\rm H\\,II}$ regions appear to fluoresce in red light.\n",

Let $N$ be the number of photons *per second* produced by a massive O or B star that is producing the ionizing radiation and $\\alpha n_e n_H$ is the number of recombinations *per unit volume per second*.  The latter quantity depends on a quantum-mechanical recombination coefficient that describes the likelihood that a hydrogen atom will recombine given their number densities.

    "### The Effects of Massive Stars on Gas Clouds\n",
    "Through the formation of massive protostars, the temperature will begin to rise in the molecular cloud, where the dust will vaporize and molecules will dissociated before the star reaches the main sequence.  After reaching the main sequence, the surrounding gas will ionize, resulting tin the creation of a ${\\rm H\\,II}$ region inside of a ${\\rm H\\,I}$ region.  Due to the star's high luminosity, radiation pressure will begin to drive significant mass loss that can disperse the remainder of the cloud.  If several O and B stars form at the same time, then star formation can be halted around other protostars as they are starved for resources.  If the cloud was only marginally bound, the mass loss will result in the newly formed stars drifting apart from the initial cluster.  Some famous examples of this occurring are in the Carina Nebula (about 3000 pc from Earth) and in the [Eagle Nebula (M16)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/m16L.html).\n",

It is currently densely populated with stars $(>2000\\,{\\rm pc^{-3}})$ that are in the range of $0.5-2.0\\,M_\\odot$.

    "#### T Tauri Stars\n",
    "There is a low-mass pre-main-sequence object that represents a transition from protostars still shrouded in dust and main-sequence stars, which is called a **T Tauri** star.  These objects are named after the first star of their class located in the constellation Taurus.  T Tauri stars are characterized by unusual spectral features and by large irregular luminosity variations (with timescales on the order of days).  The masses of T Tauri stars range from $0.2-2.0\\,M_\\odot$.  Many T Tauri stars also exhibit strong emission from hydrogen (i.e., the Balmer series) ${\\rm Ca\\,II}$ (H and K), iron, and lithium.  The forbidden lines $({\\rm O\\,I\\,and\\,S\\,II})$ are also present.  The existence of forbidden lines is an indication of extremely low gas densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information can be gleaned from spectra using the shapes of the lines as a function of wavelength.  In T Tauri stars, the ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ line often exhibits a characteristic shape, where an absorption trough (at the short-wavelength edge of the line) is superimposed on a rather broad emission peak.  This unique line shape is called a **P Cygni** profile, which is named after the first star observed to have emission lines with a blueshifted absorption trough.  The existing of a P Cygni profiles indicates that the star is losing mass significantly.  *From Kirchhoff's law, emission lines are produced by a hot, diffuse gas with little intervening material.*  In this case, the emission source is an expanding shell moving perpendicular to our line of sight.  *Absorption lines are the result of light passing through a cooler, diffuse gas.*  the mass loss rates of T Tauri stars average about $\\dot{M}= 10^{-8}\\,M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$.  In some extreme cases, T Tauri stars appear to accrete mass rather than lose it, where the P Cygni profile is inverted (redshifted absorption).  Mass accretion rates appear the similar to mass loss rates.\n",
