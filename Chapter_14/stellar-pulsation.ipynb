    "A Luthern pastor and amatuer astronomer [David Fabricius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fabricius) was observing $\\omicron$ Ceti (omicron Ceti) in August 1595.  The brightness of the star slowly faded over a period of ${\\sim}$2 months and vanished from the sky by October.  The star eventually recovered and returned to its former brilliance after a couple of months.  By 1662, the star was named [Mira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira), which is Latin for astonishing.  Also by this time, the 11-month period of its cycle was established.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The regular changes in brightness were mistakenly attributed to dark \"blotches\" on the stellar surface.  Supposedly, Mira would appear fainter when the dark areas were turned toward Earth.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Today astronomers recognize that the changes in Mira's brightness are not due to dark spots on its surface, but to the fact that Mira is a **pulsating star**, or a star tha dims and brightens as its surface expands and contracts.  Mira is the protoype of the **long-period variables**, or stars that have irregular light curves and pulsation periods between $100-700$ days.\n",

He found that the brightness of [$\\delta$ Cephei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cephei) varies regularly with a period of 5.367 days (or 5 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes).  Goodricke contracted pneumonia while observing $\\delta$ Cephei and died at the age of 21.  $\\delta$ Cephei is different than Mira, in that it varies by less than one magnitude in brightness and never fades from view.  Pulstation stars similar to $\\delta$ Cephei are called **classical Cepheids** and are vitally important to astronomy.\n",

    "In the early 20th century, [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt) was hired at Harvard University to compare photographic plates of the same field of stars taken at different times and detect any star that varied in brightness.  Eventually she discovered 2400 classical Cepheids with perios between $1-50$ days, where most of them were located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  Leavitt noticed that the more lumious Cepheids took longer to complete their pulsation cycles, where she compared the *apparent magnitudes* of the these SMC stars against their *pulsation periods*.  As a result, she demonstrated that the apparent magnitudes of classical Cepheids are closely correlated with their peirods, with an uncertainty of only $\\Delta m \\approx \\pm 0.5$ at a given period.\n",

    "\n",
    "The distance to the SMC is large compared to the distance between stars, so we can assume that all the stars in SMC are roughly the same distance from us (about 91 kpc).  The differences in their apparent magnitudes must be the same as the differences in their absolute magnitudes.  The observed differences in the apparent brightness of the stars must reflect intrinsic differences in their luminosities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate distances to stars (via parallax) are limited to only the nearest (less than ${\\sim}$10 kpc with the Gaia spacecraft) from us due to the ambiguity in a star's apparent brightness as a function of distance.  Astronomers were excited at the prospect of determing the absolute magnitude (or luminosity) of a distant Cepheid simply by timing its pulsation.  Recall that the difference between a star's apparent and absolute magnitude allows for the an independent distance calculation via the distance modulus.  This would permit the measurement of large distances in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only stumbling block was the *calibration* of Leavitt's relation.  An independent distance to a single Cepheid had to be obtained to measure its absolute magnitude and luminosity.  The resulting **period-luminosity relation** could be used to measure the distance to any Cepheid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest classical Cepheid is Polaris (some 200 pc away).  In the early 20th century, this distance was much to great to be measured via stellar parallax.  However, Hertzsprung (in 1913) succeed by using the longer baseline provided by the Sun's motion through space (along with statistical methods) to find the distances to Cepheids haveing a specified period.  The calibrated period-luminosity relation for the $V$ band is described by\n",

    "A problem of measuring stars in the $V$ band is interstellar extinction and reddening is more signficant.  Astronomers can substantially decrease the scatter in the period-luminosity relation by making observations at **infrared** wavelengths, where interstellar extinction is less of a problem.  A fit of the period-luminosity relation in the infrared $H$ band is given by\n",

    "### The Pulsation Hypothesis for Brightness Variations\n",
    "A detailed understanding of the physical reasons for the light variations of Cepheids is no required to appreciate the important ues of Cepheids as cosmic distance indicators.  The observed changes in brightness were once thought to have originated with the tidal effects of binary stars.\n",

    "\n",
    ">The observed variations in the brightness and temperature of the classical Cepheids were caused by radial pulsations of single stars. He proposed that these stars were rhythmically \"breathing\" in and out, which corresponded to the process of brightening and dimming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years later Eddington provided a firm theoretical framework for the pulsation hypothesis, which received strong support from the observed correlations among the variations in brightness, temperature, and surface velocity throughout the pulsation cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in brightness is primarily due to the ${\\sim}1000\\ {\\rm K}$ variation in the surface temperature of $\\delta$ Cephei.  The accompaning change in size makes a lesser contribution to the luminosity.  Although the total excursion of $\\delta$ Cephei's surface from its equilibrium radius is large in absolute terms ($\\gtrsim 1R_\\odot$), it is still only ${\\sim}5-10\\%$ the size of a supergiant star.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral type of $\\delta$ Cephei changes continuously through the cycle from ${\\rm F5-G2}$ (hottest-coolest).  A careful examination of Fig. {numref}`{number}<pulsation-fig>` shows that the magnitude and surface velocity curves are nearly identical in shape.  *The star is brightest when its surface is expanding outward most rapidly, after it has passed through its minimum radius.*  The **phase lag** of maximum luminosity is due to the mechanism that maintains its oscillations. \n",

By numerically evaluating an evolutionary sequence of stellar models and comparing the pulsational characteristics (e.g., periods, amplitudes, etc.) of the models with observations, astronomers can further test their theories of stellar structure and evolution.  Moreover, they obtain a detailed view of the stellar interior in the process.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the **fundamental mode**, the gases move in the same direction at every point in the star or pipe.  There is a single node between the center and the surface, which represents the **first overtone** mode, with the gases moving in opposite directions on either side of the node, and two ndes for the **second overtone**.\n",

The RR Lyrae variables pulsate in either the fundamental or the first overtone, with a few oscillations in both modes simultaneously.

    "### Eddington's Thermodynamic Heat Engine\n",
    "To explain the mechanism that powers these standing sound waves, Eddington proposed that pulsating stars are **thermodynamic heat engines**.  The gases comprising the layers of the star do thermodynamic work $(PdV)$ as they expand and contract throughout the pulsation cycle.\n",

    "- If the total work is negative, then the oscillations will decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes in pulsation amplitude continue until an equilibrium value is reached, when the total work done by all the layers is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for any heat engine, the net work done by each layer of the star during one cycle is the difference between heat flowing into the gas and the heat leaving the gas.  For driving, the heat must enter the layer during the high-temperature part of the cycle and leave during the low-temperature part.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Just as the spark plug in an internal combustion engine (ICE) fires at the end of the compression stroke, the driving layers of a pulsating star must absorb heat around the time of their maximum compression.

    "The location of these ionization zones with the star determines its pulsational properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the star is too hot ($7500\\ {\\rm K}$), the ionization zones will be very near the surface.  At this position, the density is quite low, and there is not enough mass available to drive the oscillations effectively.  This accounts for the hot **blue edge** of the instability strip on the H-R diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a cooler star ($6500\\ {\\rm K}$), the characteristic temperatures of the ionzation zones are found deeper in the star.  There is more mass for the ionization zone \"piston\" to push around, and the first overtone mode may be excited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a still cooler star ($5500\\ {\\rm K}$), the ionization zones occur deep enough to drive the fundamental mode of pulsation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if a star's surface temperature is too low, the onset of efficient convection in its outer layers may dampen the oscillations.  The transport of enerby via convection is more effective when the star is compressed, and the convecting stellar material may lose heat at the minimum radius.  This would overcome the damming up of heat by the ionization zones and quench the pulsation of the star.  The cool **red edge** of the instability strip is the result of the damping effect of convection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed numerical calculations demonstrate a good agreement for the location of the instablilty strip on the H-R diagram.  These computations show that it is the $\\rm He\\ II$ partial ionization zone that is primarily responsible for driving stellar oscillations within the instability strip.  If the effect of the helium ionization is artificially removed, then the model stars will not pulsate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrogen ionization zone plays a more subtle role.  As a star pulsates, the hydrogen ionization zone moves toward or away from the surface as the zone expands and contracts in response to the changing temperature of the stellar gases.  The star is brightest when the *least mass* lies between the hydrogen ionziation zone and the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a star oscillates, the location of an ionization zone changes with respect to both its radial position $r$ and the mass enclosed $M_r$.  The luminosity incident on the *bottom* of the hydrogen ionization zone is a maximum *at minimum radius*, but this propels the zone outward (through mass) most rapidly at that instant.  The emergent luminosity is greatest *after* minimum radius, when the zone is nearest the surface.  The delaying action (of the hydrogen partial ionization zone) produces the phase lag observed for classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanisms repsonsible for the pulsation of stars outside the instability strip are not always well understood.  The long-period variables (LPVs) are red supergiants with huge, diffuse convective envelopes surrounding a compact ocre.  Their spectra are dominated by molecular absorption lines and emission lines that reveal the existence of atmospheric shock waves and significant mass loss.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\beta$ Cephei Stars and the Iron Opacity \"Bump\"\n",
    "The $\\beta$ Cephei stars pose another interesting challenge, where they are located in the upper left-hand side of the H-R diagram (i.e., very hot and luminous).  $\\beta$ Cepheis are early B stars with effective temperatures from $2-3 \\times 10^4\\ {\\rm K}$ and typically luminosity classes of III, IV, and V.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given their high effective temperatures, hydrogen is completely ionized, and the helium ionization zone is too near the surface to effectively drive pulsations.  After many years, it was realized tha the $\\kappa$ and $\\gamma$ mechanisms are still active in $\\beta$ Cephei stars, but the element responsible for the driving is iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger number of absorption lines in the spectrum of iron implies that iron contributes significantly to stellar opacities at temperatures near $10^5\\ {\\rm K}$.  This effect can be seen in the \"iron bump\" above $10^5\\ {\\rm K}$ in the plot of opacity.  The depth of this iron ionization region is sufficient to produce net positive pulsational driving in these stars."

    "## Modeling Stellar Pulsation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinear Hydrodynamic Models\n",
    "A pulsating star is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, where a more general set of equations is employed that takes the oscillation of mass shells into account.  For example, Newton's second law\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\rho \\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = -\\frac{GM_r \\rho}{r^2} - \\frac{dP}{dr},\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "must be used for hydrostatic equilibrium.  But the differential equations describing nonequilibrium mechanical and thermal behavior of a star are needed.  Such equations may be replaced by *difference equations* and solved numerically.  The model star is displaced from its equilibrium configuration and \"released\" to begin its oscillation.  The mass shells expand and contract, pushing against each other as they move.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conditions are right, the ionization zones in the model star will drive the oscillations, and the pulsation amplitude will slowly increase; otherwise the amplitude will fade away.  Computer programs that carry out these calculations have been successful in modeling the details observed in the light and radial velocity curves of Cepheid variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of the preceeding approach is that it is a **nonlinear** calculation, capable (in principle) of modeling the complexitites of large pulsation amplitudes and reproducing the nonsinusoidal shape of *actual* light curves.  One disadvantage lies in the computer resources required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process requires a significant amount of CPU time andmemory.\n",
    "- Many (sometimes thousands of) oscillations must be evaluated before the model settles down into a well-behaved periodic motion.\n",
    "- Even more periods may be required for the model to reach its *limit cycle*, when the pulsation amplitude has reached its final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases the computer simulations of certain classes of pulsating stars may never attain a truly periodic solution but exhibit chaotic behavior instead, as observed in some real stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second disadvantage of nonlinear calulations lies in the challenges involved in accurately convering models at each time step.  Numerical instabilities in the nonlinear equations can cause calculations to lead to unphysical solutions.  This is particularly true when theories of time-dependent convection are required for red giants and supergiants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearizing the Hydrodynamic Equaitons\n",
    "An alternative to the nonlinear approach is to **linearize** the differential equaitons by considering only small-amplitude oscillations.  This is done by writing every variable in the differential equations as an equilibrium value plus a small change due to the pulsation (i.e., a perturbative method).  For example, the pressure $P$ would be written as $P = P_o + \\delta P$, where $P_o$ is the pressure in a mass shell of the equilibrium model, and $\\delta P$ is the small change in pressure that occurs as that mass shell moves in the oscillating model star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\delta P$ varies in time, while $P_o$ is a constant.  When the variables written in this manner are inserted into the differential equations, the terms containing only equilibrium quantities cancel, and terms that involve powers greater than second order (i.e., greater than $(\\delta P)^2) may be discarded because they are negligibly small.  The resulting linearized differential equations and their associated boundary conditions (also linearized) are similar to the equations for a wave on a string or in an organ pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only certain standing waves with specific periods are permitted, where the the pulsation modes of the star are clearly identified.  The equations are sufficiently complicated that the motion of the star is forced to be sinusoidal, and the limiting value of the pulsation amplitude cannot be determined.  Modeling the complexities of the full nonlinear behavior of the stellar model is thus sacrificed."
