    "# The Fate of Massive Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post-Main-Sequence Evolution of Massive Stars\n",
    "Since at least 1600, astronomers have observed [$\\eta$ Carinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae), where its apparent magnitude was reported to be either 2 or 4.  In the early 1800s, it may have become significantly more active.  In 1837, $\\eta$ Car suddenly brightened, fluctuating in magnitude between $0-1$ and made it the second brightest object in the sky (only Sirius was brighter).  This brightening event is remarkable because the star is approximately 2300 pc from Earth, where Sirius is only 2.64 pc away.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 1856, $\\eta$ Car began to fade and dropped in magnitude to 8 by 1870.  Since 1895, $\\eta$ Car has been relatively quiet and it has brightened slightly to a magnitude 6 over the past ~150 years.  In a similar fashion, P Cygni was too faint to see with the naked eye before 1600, but suddenly brightened to a magnitude 3.  Following this event, P Cyg faded for a time and reappeared in 1655 becoming nearly as bright as it was in 1600.  Since 1700, P Cyg has been a magnitude 5 star, although it may have brighten slightly over the past several centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Luminous Blue Variables\n",
    "A small number of other stars in our own galaxy (some farther away) behave like $\\eta$ Car and P Cyg.  For example S Doradus (located in the Large Magellanic Cloud) is the best known extragalactic example.  Similar stars were discovered by Edwin Hubble and Allan Sandage, where this class of star are referred to as **S Doradus variables**, **Hubble-Sandage variables**, and **luminous blue variables** (LBVs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "An extreme example of an LBV is $\\eta$ Car, where it is known as the \"[homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae#Homunculus)\" for its bipolar structure and equatorial disk.  From Doppler measurements, the lobes of $\\eta$ Car expand outward at $650\\ {\\rm km/s}$ and a range of velocities are recorded along any particular line-of-sight.  The expanding lobes are hollow, while the material in the shells contain molecules of ${\\rm H_2}$, ${\\rm CH}$, and ${\\rm OH}$.  It appears that the homunculus is significantly depleted in ${\\rm C}$ and ${\\rm O}$, while enriched in ${\\rm He}$ and ${\\rm N}$.  This suggests that the ejected material has been processed by the CNO cycle.  The present mass loss rate of $\\eta$ Car is $\\sim 10^{-3}\\ M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$, but it has probably ejected $1-3\\ M_\\odot$ during the 20 years following the Great Eruption of 1837.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Great Eruption, $\\eta$ Car's luminosity could have been $4\\times$ brighter than its present quiescent luminosity ($\\sim 5\\times10^6\\ {\\rm L_\\odot}$).  The central star's effective temperature is roughly 30,000 K. As of 2007, the apparent magnitude in the visual was $m_V \\sim 6$, but now (2018) it has brightened to $m_V \\sim 4.3$.  Most of $\\eta$ Car's luminosity is initially emitted in the UV, which explains its high effective temperature.  Much of the UV is scattered, absorbed, and re-emitted by dust grains into the IR.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a class, LBV's tend to have high effective temperatures (15,000-30,000 K), with luminosities greater than $10^6\\ {\\rm L_\\odot}$.  As a result, LBVs are in the upper left-hand portion of the H-R diagram.  LBVs are clearly evolved, post-main-sequence stars given the composition of their atmospheres and ejecta.  LBVs also cluster in an instability region of the H-R diagram, which suggests that their behavior is transient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of mechanisms were proposed to explain the variability and dramatic mass loss of LBVs.  the upper end of the main sequence is very near the [Eddington luminosity limit](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_11/interiors-of-stars.html#the-eddington-luminosity-limit) where the force due to the radiation pressure may equal of exceed the gravitational force on the outer surface layers of a star.  The derived expression for the Eddington luminosity limit is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_{{\\rm ED}} = \\frac{4\\pi Gc}{\\kappa}M, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which depends on the opacity $\\kappa$ and stellar mass $M$.  The \"classical\" Eddington limit assumes that the opacity is solely due to the scattering of free electrons, which is [constant](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_9/stellar-atmospheres.html#general-sources-of-opacity) $\\sigma_T$ for a completely ionized gas. A \"modified\" Eddington limit was proposed by [Humphreys & Davidson (1994)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PASP..106.1025H/abstract), where some temperature-dependent factor of opacity modifies the overall opacity as the star evolves to the right in the H-R diagram.  As the temperature decreases and the *opacity increases*, the Eddington luminosity would drop below the actual luminosity of the star.  This implies that the radiation pressure dominates over gravity, which drives mass loss from the envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second suggestion is that atmospheric pulsation instabilities may develop, like Cepheids, RR Lyrae, long-period variable stars.  Also intriguing is the apparent high rotation velocity of some LBVs.  Rapid rotation would result in decreasing the \"effective\" gravity at the equator due to centrifugal effects and allow for gases to be driven away from the surface at the equator.  The disk around $\\eta$ Car may have formed from a high spin during the lesser eruption between 1887-1895.\n",
    "\n",
    "LBVs could also be members of binary star systems as similar behaviors can be induced by the binary companion.  Interestingly, $\\eta$ Car exhibits a 5.54 yr periodicity in the equivalent widths (of some) of its spectral lines, which hints at the presence of a binary companion.  Although it is unclear how a binary companion can cause all of the effects observed.  It may turn out that more than one of the discussed mechanisms could influence the behavior of the LBVs or the principal mechanism has yet to be identified."

    "### Wolf-Rayet Stars\n",
    "Closely related to LBVs are the [Wolf-Rayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star) (WR) stars, which were first discovered by [Charles Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wolf_(astronomer)) and [Georges Rayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Rayet) while working at the Paris Observatory in 1867.  Using a visual-wavelength spectrometer to conduct a survey of stars in Cygnus, they observed three stars (within one degree of each other) that exhibited strong, very broad emission lines rather than the typical absorption lines observed in other stars.  Today 220+ WR stars have been identified in the Milky Way, although the total number of WRs is estimated to be 1000-2000 on the basis of sampling statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with strong emission lines, WR stars are very hot, with effective temperatures of $25,000-100,000\\ {\\rm K}$.  WRs are also losing mass ($>10^{-5}\\ M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$) with wind speeds from $800-3000\\ {\\rm km/s}$. There is strong evidence that many (perhaps all) WR stars are rapid rotators with equatorial speeds of $\\sim 300\\ {\\rm km/s}$.  LBVs are all very massive stars ($85\\ M_\\odot$), but WRs can have progenitor masses as low as $20\\ M_\\odot$.  Also, WRs do not demonstrate the dramatic variability that is characteristic of LBVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the unusual spectra really sets WR stars apart from other stars.  The spectra also reveal a spectra that we today recognize as three classes: WN, WC, and WO.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WNs are dominated by emission lines of helium and nitrogen, although emission from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen is detectable in some cases.\n",
    "- WCs exhibit emission lines of helium and carbon, with a distinct absence of nitrogen and hydrogen lines.\n",
    "- WOs are much rarer than either WNs or WCs.  They have spectra containing prominent oxygen lines, with some contribution from highly ionized species.\n",
    "\n",
    "WN and WC stars are further subclassified based on the degree of ionization in their atmospheres.  They are also classified as \"early\" (E) or \"late\" (L).  For example, for the WN stars:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *WN2* stars show spectral lines of ${\\rm He\\ II}$, ${\\rm N\\ IV}$, and ${\\rm O\\ VI}$.\n",
    "- *WN9* stars contain spectra of low-ionization species, such as ${\\rm He\\ I}$ and ${\\rm N\\ III}$. \n",
    "- *WNE* stars are Wolf-Rayet stars of ionization classes WN2-WN5.\n",
    "- *WNL* stars are ionization classes WN6-WN11.\n",
    "\n",
    "and for the WC stars:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *WC4* stars have higher ionization levels (${\\rm He\\ II,\\ O\\, IV,\\ C\\ VI}$)\n",
    "- *WC9* stars exhibit lower ionization levels, such as ${\\rm He\\ I}$ and ${\\rm C\\ II}$\n",
    "- *WCE*s range from WC4-WC6\n",
    "- *WCL*s range from WC7-WC9\n",
    "\n",
    "A trend in composition from WN $\\rightarrow$ WC $\\rightarrow$ WO was eventually recognized as a direct consequence of the stellar mass loss.  WNs have lost virtually all of their hydrogen-dominated envelopes, which reveals the material synthesized by nuclear reactions in the core.  Core convection brings material to the surface that has been processed by the CNO cycle.  Additional mass loss results in the ejection of the CNO processed material, which exposes the helium-burning material generated by the triple alpha process.  If the star survives long enough, mass loss will eventually strip away all but the oxygen component of the triple-alpha ash.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to LBVs and WRs, the upper portion of the H-R diagram also contains **blue supergiants** (BSG), **red supergiants**, and **Of** stars (O supergiants with pronounced emission lines)."

    "### The Humphreys-Davidson Luminosity Limit\n",
    "The massive-star evolutionary tracks indicate that the most massive stars never evolve to the red supergiant (RSG) portion of the H-R diagram.  This is consistent with observations.  Humphreys and Davidson first pointed out the there is an upper-luminosity cut-off in the H-R diagram that includes a diagonal component running from highest luminosities and effective temperatures to lower values in both parameters.  When full redward evolutionary tracks develop for stars below $\\sim 40\\ M_\\odot$, the **Humphreys-Davidson luminosity limit** continues at constant luminosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very massive stars are extremely rare (only one $100\\ M_\\odot$ star exists for every one million solar mass stars), but they play a major role in the dynamics and chemical evolution of the ISM.  The tremendous amount of kinetic energy deposited in the ISM through the stellar winds of massive stars has an impact on the kinematics of the ISM.  When very massive stars form, they have the ability to quench (stop) star formation in neighboring regions.  The UV light from massive stars can also ionize gas clouds around them.  The highly enriched gases of massive stellar winds increase the metal content of the ISM, resulting in the formation of increasingly metal-rich stars."

    "In 1006, an extremely bright star suddenly appeared in the constellation [Lupus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_(constellation)), which reached an estimated visual magnitude of $m_V = -9$ and it was reportedly bright enough to read by at night (compared to a full Moon, $m_V = -12.5$, which is $\\sim 25\\times$ brighter).  The event was recorded by astrologers across Europe, China, Japan, Egypt, and Iraq.  Based on their writings, the bright star appeared bout April 30, 1006 and faded from view roughly one year later.  Today, this event is called **Supernova 1006** (SN 1006).\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "A very small number of supernovae have been [recorded from historical writings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_supernova_observation) more than 2000 years ago.  When a supernova date or year is given, it is most likely referring to A.D. or CE.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other similar events have been recorded through human history, although they are rare.  Only 48 years after the 1006 event, a \"guest star\" appeared in the constellation Taurus.  Yang Wei-T'e, a court astrologer during China's Sung dynasty, recorded the event and noted that *after more than a year it gradually became invisible.*  The star was also noted by the Japanese, Koreans, and Arabs (appearing in an Arabic medical textbook).  The Europeans may have witnessed the event as well, but the evidence is unclear.  Like the previous event, the amazing star was visible during daylight (like the Moon is at times).  Modern astronomers have identified a rapidly expanding cloud, which is the reported location of the ancient \"guest star\" and is known as the **Crab supernova remnant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another star suddenly appeared in the heavens about 500 years later that was witnessed by Tycho Brahe in 1572.  The strange occurrence was clearly in contrast to the Western belief that the heavens were unchanging.  Johannes Kepler also witnessed a supernova explosion in 1604, where these two events are now known as **Tycho's supernova** and **Kepler's supernova**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler's supernova was the last observed supernova to occur in the Milky Way.  On February 24, 1987 at 23 UT, Ian Shelton detected **SN 1987A** just southwest of a massive molecular cloud region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) known as 30 Doradus; the observation was made with a 10-inch astrograph (Newtonian reflector) at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  The LMC is a dwarf galaxy and only 50 kpc from Earth.  It was quickly realized that the progenitor of the supernova was a blue supergiant (BSG) star.  Nicholas Sanduleak had cataloged the star [Sk -69 202](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanduleak_-69_202) while investigating hot stars in the Magellanic Clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes of Supernovae\n",
    "Today, astronomers routinely observe supernovae in other galaxies, where the \"A\" in SN 1987A represents the first supernova reported that year.  However, supernovae are exceedingly rare events, which typically occur about *once very 100 years in any one galaxy*.  There are many galaxies to study and over time, it has been realized that there are several distinct classes of supernovae with different classes of underlying progenitors and mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type I** supernovae were identified as those without any hydrogen lines in their spectra.  Given that hydrogen is the most abundant element, this was an indication of something unusual.  These supernovae are further subdivided according to their spectra.\n",
    "    - **Type Ia** show a strong ${\\rm Si\\ II}$ line at 615 nm.\n",
    "    - **Type Ib** or **Ic** are classified by the respective presence or absence of strong helium lines.\n",
    "- **Type II** supernovae contain strong hydrogen lines, in contrast to the Type I supernovae.\n",
    "    - **Type II-L** show a *linear* decrease in the apparent magnitude $m_B$ after the maximum.\n",
    "    - **Type II-P** show a *plateau* between 30-80 days in the apparent magnitude $m_B$ after the maximum.  Type II-P supernovae occur approximately 10 times more often than Type II-L supernovae.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of hydrogen lines in Type I supernovae indicates that the progenitor stars were stripped of their hydrogen envelopes.  The differences in the spectral signatures between each Type I (a, b, or c) indicate that different physical mechanisms are at work.  Type Ia are found in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals that show very little evidence of recent star formation (e.g., ${\\rm H\\ II}$ regions).  Short-lived, massive stars are probably involved with Types Ib and Ic (to expose or get rid of the excess helium), but not with Type Ia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical peak brightness of a Type Ia is $M_B = -18.4$, while the light curves of Types Ib and Ic are fainter by 1.5-2 magnitudes (in blue light).  All Type I supernovae show similar rates of decline of their brightness after the maximum with a decline of $0.065 \\pm 0.007$ magnitude per day at 20 days.  After about 50 days the dimming slows and becomes constant, where a Type Ia declines 50% faster $(0.015\\ {\\rm mag/day})$ than the other Type Is $(0.010\\ {\\rm mag/day})$.  It is believed that SN 1006, Tycho (SN 1572), and Kepler (Sn 1604) were all Type I.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observationally, Type II supernovae are characterized by a rapid rise in luminosity and reach a maximum brightness that is typically 1.5 magnitudes dimmer than a Type Ia.  The peak light output is followed by a steady decrease, which drops 6-8 magnitudes in a year.  Their spectra also exhibit lines associate with hydrogen and heavier elements.  P Cygni profiles are common in many lines, which indicates rapid expansion.  The Crab supernova (SN 1054) and SN 1987A were Type II.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature loves to confound our clean classification schemes, where SN 1993J (in M81) initially displayed strong hydrogen emission lines and follows the Type II scheme.  Within a month the hydrogen lines were replaced by helium and its appearance changed to a Type Ib.  This suggests that Type Ib and Type II supernovae are related in some way."

    "### The Subluminous Nature of SN 1987A\n",
    "The mystery of the subluminous nature of SN 1987a was solved after identifying its progenitor star, which was a spectral class B3 I *blue* supergiant, [Sk -69 202](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanduleak_-69_202).  Since the progenitor was a BSG instead of a RSG (as is usually assumed), the star was more dense.  Before the thermal energy produced by the shock could diffuse out and escape, it was converted into the mechanical energy required to lift the envelope of the star out of the deeper potential well of the blue supergiant.  Measurements of ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ lines indicate that some of the outer hydrogen envelope was ejected at speeds of nearly $30,000\\ {\\rm km/s}$, or $0.1c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available observations of Sk -69 202 tied with the theoretical evolutionary models suggest that the progenitor of SN 1987A had a mass of roughly $20\\ M_\\odot$ when it was on the main sequence and it lost a few solar masses ($\\sim 1.4-1.6\\ M_\\odot$) before its iron core collapsed.  Although it was apparently a RSG for $\\sim 10^5-10^6\\ {\\rm yr}$, where it evolved to the BSG just 40,000 years before the explosion.  Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that hydrogen was more abundant in the stellar envelope than helium, which suggests that the star had not suffered an extensive amount of mass loss.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Supernova Remnants\n",
    "There are now many examples of **supernova remnants** (SNR), such as the Crab Nebula that tis located in Taurus.  Nearly 1000 years since the SN 154 explosion, the Crab is still expanding a $\\sim 1450\\ {\\rm km/s}$ and it has a luminosity of 80,000 $L_\\odot$.  Much of the emitted radiation is in the form of highly polarized synchrotron radiation, which indicates the presence of relativistic electrons that are spiraling around magnetic field lines.  The ongoing source of the electrons and the continued high luminosity so long after the explosion were major puzzles until the discovery of a **pulsar** (i.e., a rapidly spinning neutron star) at the center of the Crab SNR.  The Cygnus Loop nebula is another example of a SNR, where it is located 800 pc away and is 15,000 years old.  The remnant shows shock fronts several AU wide as the debris from the supernova explosion encounters material in the ISM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass loss prior to the supernova explosion of SN 1987A could not have been excessive, the progenitor did lose some mass that results in a very unusual structure around the expanding SNR.  The Hubble Space Telescope has recorded three rings around SN 1987A, where the innermost ring measures 0.42 pc across and lies in a plane that contains the center of the SNR.  It glows in the visible,  which is a consequence of ${\\rm O\\ III}$ emission that is energized by the supernova's radiation and appears elongated because it is inclined relative to *our* line of sight. The material making up the central ring was ejected by stellar winds 20,000 years before the explosion of SN 1987A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two larger rings lie in front of and behind the star (i.e., not in planes containing the central explosion).  One explanation is that SK -69 202 had a nearby companion object (possibly a neutron star or black hole).  As the companion source wobbles, narrow jets of radiation from the source would \"paint\" the rings in an hourglass-shaped bipolar distribution.  In support of this hypothesis, researcher may have identified the source of these beams, which is about 0.1 pc from the center of the supernova explosion.  Opponents of this model suggest that the explanation is too complicated, where it requires two sources of high-energy radiation: one to explain the central ring and another to explain larger ones.  Alternatively the larger rings could be the product of a hot, fast stellar wind from the BSG progenitor overtaking the slower, cooler wind given off  by the star when it was a RSG.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summer of 1990, fluctuating radio emission was detected from the supernova.  Apparently the shock wave collided with clumps of material lost from SK -69 202 prior to the supernova explostion.  The shock front from the expanding supernova remnant began to collide with the slower-moving stellar wind comprising the inner ring in 1996.  Bright clumps in the inner ring developed over the next several years.\n",

    "\n",
    "The arrival of the neutrino burst wes recored over a duration of 12.5 seconds that was three hours *before* the arrival of the photons.  Twelve events were recorded at Japan's Kamiokande II Cerenkov detector and contemporaneously, eight events were detected by the IMB Cenrenkov detector near Fairport, OH.  The neutrions began their trip ahead of the photons assuming the the exploding star became optically thin to neutrions before the shock wave reached the surface and the neutrionos traveled faster than the shock while still inside the star.  Also the neutrinos must have been very near the speed of light to not be overtaken by the photons.  There was not a significant dispersion in the neutrino energy, which suggests that the rest mass of the electron neutrions must be quite small.  Based on data from SN 1987A, the electron neutrino mass was less than 16 eV, which is consistent with lab experiments that place the upper limit at 2.2 eV.\n",

The purported detection comes from an IR excess due to the decay ${\\rm ^{44}Ti}$, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or black hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spin down of a pulsar, or to thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star.  The upper limit on the luminosity in the visible is less than $8\\times 10^{26}\\ {\\rm W}$, which is equivalent to the optical energy output of an F6 main-sequence star.
