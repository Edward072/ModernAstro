    "## The Discovery of Sirius B\n",
    "In 1838, [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel) used the technique of stellar parallax to find the distance to the star 61 Cygni.  The next candidate Bessel tried was [Sirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), the brightest star in the sky.  It's parallax angle is $p = 0.379^{\\prime\\prime}$, which corresponds to a distance of only 2.64 pc, or 8.61 ly. Sirius' brilliance is due (in part) to its proximy to Earth.  Bessel tracked Sirius' path across the sky and found that it deviated slightly from a straight line.  Using 10 years of precise observation, Bessel concluded (in 1844) that Sirius was actually a binary star system.  He deduced that the binary orbital period was 50 years, where the modern value is $50.1284 \\pm 0.0043$ years ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)) and the position of the secondary star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bessel's telecopses were incapable of finding the \"Pup\" (i.e., the unseen companion of the luminous \"Dog Star\") due to the glare of Sirius.  After Bessel's death in 1846, the search for the Pup waned.  In 1862, [Alvan Graham Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvan_Graham_Clark) tested his father's new 18-inch refractor (3 inches longer than any previous instrument) on Sirius, and he discovered the Pup at its predicted position.  The dominant Sirius A was measured to be nearly $1000\\times$ brighter than the Pup (now called Sirius B).  The orbits of the stars about their center of mass revealed that Sirius A and Sirius B are about $2.3\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.0\\ M_\\odot$, respectively.  The modern values are $2.063 \\pm 0.023\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.018 \\pm 0.011\\ M_\\odot$ ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clark's discovery of Sirius B was made when the stars were most widely separated (by just $10^{\\prime\\prime}$).  The great difference in their lumionsities: $L_A = 25.4\\ L_\\odot$ and $L_B=0.056\\ L_\\odot$."
