    "## 5.1 Spectral Lines\n",
    "Some philosophers during the Renaissance considered strict limits to human knowledge, while other natural philosophers used experimentation to probe reality.  in 1800, William Wollaston showed that a number of **dark spectral lines** were present within the a rainbow-like spectrum using sunlight.  By 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer cataloged 475 of the dark lines (i.e., **Fraunhofer lines**) in the solar spectrum. Fraunhofer determined that the wavelength of one prominent dark line in the Sun's spectrum corresponds to the yellow light emitted by salt in a flame.  The new science of *spectroscopy* was born with the discovery of the sodium line.\n",

    "### 5.1.1 Kirchoff's Laws\n",
    "The foundations of spectroscopy (and modern chemistry) were established in the 1800s with Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchoff.  Bunsen's burner produced a colorless flame that was ideal for studying the colors produced by burning a range of substances.  Bunsen and Kirchoff desinged a *spectroscope* that passed the light of a flame spectrum through a prism.  They determined that the wavelengths of light absorbed and emitted by an element fit together like a lock and key.  Kirchoff determined that 70 of the Fraunhofer lines were due to iron vapor.  In 1860, Kirchoff and Bunsen developed the idea that every element produces its own pattern of spectral lines and thus the elements had \"fingerprints\".  Kirchoff summarized the production of spectral lines in three laws (i.e., **Kirchoff's Laws**):\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hot, dense gas or hot solid object produces a continuous spectrum with no dark spectral lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hot diffuse gas produces bright spectral lines (**emission lines**). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A cool, diffuse gas in front of a asource of a continuous spectrum produces dark spectral lines (**absorption lines**) in the continuous spectrum.\n",

    "Using the development of spectral fingerprints, a new element *helium* was discovered spectroscopically in the Sun (in 1868) and found on Earth in 1895.  Another fich line of investigate was pursued by measuring the Doppler shifts of the spectral lines.  For most cases at the time, the *low-speed approximation* ($v_r \\ll c$) was adequate to determine the radial velocities $v_r$ by the following equation,\n",
