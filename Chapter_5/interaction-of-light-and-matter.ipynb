    "## Spectral Lines\n",
    "Some philosophers during the Renaissance considered strict limits to human knowledge, while other natural philosophers used experimentation to probe reality.  in 1800, William Wollaston showed that a number of **dark spectral lines** were present within the a rainbow-like spectrum using sunlight.  By 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer cataloged 475 of the dark lines (i.e., [Fraunhofer lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines)) in the solar spectrum. Fraunhofer determined that the wavelength of one prominent dark line in the Sun's spectrum corresponds to the yellow light emitted by salt in a flame.  The new science of *spectroscopy* was born with the discovery of the sodium line.\n",

    "### Kirchoff's Laws\n",
    "The foundations of spectroscopy (and modern chemistry) were established in the 1800s with Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchoff.  Bunsen's burner produced a colorless flame that was ideal for studying the colors produced by burning a range of substances.  Bunsen and Kirchoff designed a *spectroscope* that passed the light of a flame spectrum through a prism.  They determined that the wavelengths of light absorbed and emitted by an element fit together like a lock and key.  Kirchoff determined that 70 of the Fraunhofer lines were due to iron vapor.  In 1860, Kirchoff and Bunsen developed the idea that every element produces its own pattern of spectral lines and thus the elements had \"fingerprints\".  Kirchoff summarized the production of spectral lines in three laws (i.e., **Kirchoff's Laws**):\n",

The quantum state of an electron can be described by four quantum numbers, but no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, [Pauli Exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle).  This provided an explanation for the properties of the period table of elements.  However, there wasn't a first principles reasoning for why a fourth quantum number was needed.\n",

    "Quantum mechanics was at odds with Schr&ouml;dinger's (non-relativistic) wave equation and Einstein's theory of special relativity.  Paul Dirac worked to combine the two theories and succeeded in writing a relativistic wave equation for the electron that naturally included the spin of the electron.  His relativistic wave equation extended the Pauli exclusion principle by dividing the world of particles into two groups: fermions and bosons.\n",

    "The Dirac equation also predicted the existence of **antiparticles**. A particle differs from its antiparticle in its charge and magnetic moment (e.g., electron $e^-$ and positron $e^+$); all other properties are the same.  Pairs of particles and antiparticles may be created from the energy of gamma-ray photons (e.g., $\\gamma \\rightarrow e^- + e^+$) or annihilate each other to produce gamma-rays (e.g., $e^- + e^+ \\rightarrow \\gamma$).  Such processes play a role for fusion inside of stars and in the evaporation of black holes."

    "Four quantum numbers ($n$, $\\ell$, $m_\\ell$, and $m_s$) describe a quantum state for each electron in an atom, where external magnetic fields (and other electromagnetic interactions) increase the number of possible energy levels.  Even though there are a large number of possible states to make a transition, some transitions are restricted, where Nature imposes a set of [selection rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_rule) that determines the **allowed** and **forbidden** transitions.  The allowed transitions can happen spontaneously on timescales of $10^{-8}$ s, while the requirement of $\\Delta \\ell = \\pm 1$ prevents transition from $F$ to $P$.\n",

    "The Zeeman effect shows only three transitions occur between $1s$ and $2p$ energy levels because of selection rules requiring $\\Delta m_\\ell = 0$ or $\\pm 1$ and forbidding transitions if *both* orbitals have $m_\\ell = 0$.  Similar to quantum tunneling, there remains a small but finite probability for forbidden transitions to occur and they require much longer timescales.  Collisions between atoms trigger transitions and can compete with spontaneous transitions.  Thus, very low gas densities are required to obtain a sufficient signal to measure the forbidden transitions.  In the diffuse interstellar medium or the outer atmospheres of stars, this condition is met."
