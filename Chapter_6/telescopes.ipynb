    "## Basic Optics\n",
    "The development of optics greatly enhanced our window into the universe starting with Galileo's innovative use of the telescope.  Today we \"see\" with many different sets of eyes to get a fuller picture of the cosmos, discover faint objects otherwise unseen, and resolve distant objects in greater detail.  \n",

    "### Refraction and Reflection\n",
    "The first \"telescope\" was developed by Hans Lippershey in 1608 and a year later [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) built his own version with about $3\\times$ magnification and later improved upon the design to obtain a version with $30\\times$ magnification.  These **refracting** telescopes consisted of lenses through which the light would pass and form an image.  In 1671, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) showed that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colors and he developed the **reflecting** telescope that used a mirror instead of a lens to bypass the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of telescopes use a lens to produce an image, which makes a natural starting point.  [Snell's law of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) describes how the path of a light ray changes as it travels through a lens. When a wave travels across a boundary between two media, its path is bent (*refracts*) at the interface.  The amount that the ray bends is material dependent and characterized by a wavelength-dependent index of refraction $n_\\lambda = c/v_\\lambda$, where $v_\\lambda$ represents the speed of light within the medium.  Alternatively, the index of refraction indicates how much the speed of light decreases within the medium ($v_\\lambda = c/n_\\lambda$) compared to vacuum.  Note that the frequency $\\nu$ of the wave remains unchanged and the refracted wavelength must change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incoming ray possesses an angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ and the refracted ray is bent by $\\theta_r$, where both angles are measured relative to the normal to the interface.  Then Snell's law is given by\n",

This unique point is called the **focal point** of the lens and the distance to that point from the center of the lens is called the **focal length** $f$.  By changing the curvature of the lens, the light rays can instead diverge from the optical axis to make a *diverging* lens.

There is a fundamental limit to our ability to *resolve* the objects due to the diffraction produced by the advancing wavefronts from each object.  This phenomenon is related to the single slit diffraction pattern produced by a slit of width $D$.  Any ray passing through the opening (or **aperture**) and arriving at a specific point can be though of as being associated with another ray passing through the aperture a distance of $D/2$ away and arriving at the same point.

    "### Aberrations\n",
    "Image distortions or aberrations affect both lens and mirror systems.  Refracting telescopes suffer from [chromatic aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration), which is a distortion due to the wavelength-dependent focus of a lens.  The lensmaker's formula (Eqn 2) depends on the radii of curvature and the index of refraction $n$, but $n$ also depends on the wavelength $\\lambda$.  This translates into a wavelength-dependent focal length, where the focal point for red light is different than for blue light.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be aberrations that result from the shape of the reflecting or refracting surface.  Imperfections in the grinding/polishing of lens/mirrors mean not all areas will focus a parallel set of light rays to a single point.  This type of distortion is called [spherical aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration) and can be overcome with a corrective lens.  The [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) (HST) initially had imaging problems due to spherical aberration when a mistake was made while grinding the primary and left the center of the mirror too shallow by about 2 $\\mu m$.  A repair mission in 1993, installed a special corrective optics package on the telescope.\n",

    "A **coma** produces elongated images of a point sources that lie off the optical axis. An **astigmatism** is a defect where different parts of a lens or mirror converge an image a slightly different locations on the focal plane.  Correcting for astigmatism can create other problems, such as the **curvature of field** that is due to the focusing of images on a curve rather than on a flat surface."

    "### Brightness of an Image\n",
    "It might be assumed that the brightness of an extended (resolved) image depends on the area of the aperture.  This is the case for photography, where the camera has an adjustable aperture (iris) that controls how much light enters the camera to reach the detector on the focal plane.  For most astronomical applications, the aperture is fully open because the object is effectively infinitely far away (i.e., distance $r \\gg $ focal length $f$).  Then, it can be shown that the **intensity** of the radiation is the same for both the object and image; independent of the area of the aperture.  The exception is for bright objects (e.g., the Moon), where an adjustable iris helps prevent over-exposing the image (i.e., saturation).\n",

When comparing telescopes, the amount of light collected is proportional to the area of the aperture or the illumination $J \\propto \\pi D^2/4$, where $D$ is the diameter of the telescope's aperture.  Through the plate scale (Eqn 3) we have the linear size of the image proportional to the focal length of the lens and the image area is proportional to $f^2$.  The illumination is proportional to the ratio of the aperture diameter $D$ to the focal length $f$ (i.e., $J\\propto D^2/f^2).

The objective lens collects the light and brings the light to a focus at the focal plane, where a photographic plate or other detector can be placed at the focal plane to record the image.  The eyepiece serves as a magnifying glass and would be placed a distance from the focal plane equal to its focal length $f_{\\rm eye}$.

    "\n",
    "where a review is available on [openstax.org/books/college-physics](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics/pages/26-5-telescopes).  Since the objective lens tends to be a fixed part of the telescope, several eyepieces (of different focal lengths) can be used to produce different angular magnifications.  Note that viewing a large image requires a long objective in combination with a short focal length for the eyepiece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the objective's focal length and a larger diameter objective is needed to compensate.  However, there are practical limitations for to the size of a refracting telescope's objective.  The lens is supported only around its edges and the shape of the lens deforms due to gravity when the size and weight are increased.  Furthermore, the type of deformation changes as the orientation of the telescope varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is the construction of the lens, which can have defects.  The light must pass through the *entire volume* of the lens and the quality must be nearly optically perfect.  Defects in the desired shape of the lens must be kept to a small fraction ($\\lambda/20$) of the wavelength ($\\lambda = 400-700$ nm for visible light).  A large objective lens also has a slow thermal response, where the telescope must adjust to the temperature of the outside air after the dome is opened.  Thermally driven air currents develop around the telescope, which compound the normal concerns around \"seeing\".  The overall shape of the telescope will change as a consequence of thermal expansion, which alters the optical alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all of these challenges (along with the unique problem of chromatic aberration), the vast majority of all large modern telescopes are reflectors.  The largest refracting telescope in use today is at the [Yerkes Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory) in Williams Bay, Wisconsin.  It has a 40-in (1.02 m) objective with a focal length of 19.36 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflecting Telescopes\n",
    "A reflecting telescope is designed by replacing the objective lens with a mirror, which either reduces or eliminates many of the problems with refracting telescopes.  The light does not pass through a mirror and thus, much less precision is required in its construction (i.e., only one surface needs to be ground with precision).  The weight of the mirror can be minimized by using a lighter honeycomb structure behind the reflecting surface.  As a result, parts of the mirror can be mechanically deformed to correct for thermal and/or gravitational effects as the telescope moves (i.e., [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many benefits in using a mirror, there are some costs.  The primary mirror reflects the light back along the optical axis (i.e., law of reflection) to the focal point (i.e., [prime focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope#Prime_focus)).  A detector can be placed at this location, but some of the incident light is blocked.  Additionally, the structure supporting the detector introduces diffraction spikes in the image of the stars.  Isaac Newton found a solution to the problem of the prime focus by placing a small, flat mirror in the reflected light's path changing the location of the focal point.  A [Newtonian telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope) design suffers a mechanical cost because the eyepiece (or detector) must be placed a significant distance from the telescope's center of mass and would exert a significant torque on the telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secondary mirror effectively produces a shadow on the primary mirror (rendering a small area useless) and a hole can be bored into the primary mirror so that the reflected light comes through the hole.  This [Cassegrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassegrain_reflector) design makes it possible to place a massive detector near the telescope's center of mass and the observer can stay near the bottom of the telescope.  The secondary mirror is usually convex, while the primary mirror is concave .  However, a [Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchey%E2%80%93Chr%C3%A9tien_telescope) has a hyperbolic primary mirror rather than a parabolic one.  The Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien design has a wider field of view and eliminates off-axis optical errors (coma).  Some well-known examples are the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck telescopes and the ESO Very Large Telescope. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the instrument package is too massive, astronomers use a series of mirrors to reflect the light down the telescope's mount to a *coud&eacute; room* located below the telescope (i.e., **coud&eacute; telescope**).  Because of the extended optical path, a very long focal length is needed and is particularly useful in spectral line studies.  A modification of the Cassegrain design uses a spheroidal primary mirror (to minimize coma) combined with a \"correcting\" lens to help remove spherical aberration.  The benefit of a [Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt%E2%80%93Cassegrain_telescope) is a wider field of view and is important for survey studies of large regions of sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive Optics\n",
    "While large-aperture ground-based telescopes have a larger light-gathering power than small telescopes, they are still limited in resolving power due to thermal fluctuations of the atmosphere.  Even the Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea cannot resolve a source any better than a 0.2 m telescope without the aide of *active optics* to correct the distortions in the telescope's mirrors and [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics) to compensate for atmospheric turbulence.  A small deformable (\"rubber\") mirror is used with many piezoelectric crystals attached to the back.  To counteract changes in the shape of wavefronts due to Earth's atmosphere, the crystals make $\\mu m$-size adjustments to the shape of the mirror several hundred times per second.  To make the needed adjustments, the telescope monitors a guide star that is very near the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space-based Observatories\n",
    "To overcome the imaging problems imposed by Earth's atmosphere, observational astronomy has made leaps through observatories on satellites in space.  The [Hubble Space Telescope]() has a 2.4 m (f/24) primary using a Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien design, where long exposures of 150+ hours allow the telescope to detect objects as faint as $m_V = +30$.  On December 25, 2021 the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) (JWST) was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket.  This telescope has a 6.5 m primary and will orbit at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point (L2).  This location was chosen for the spacecraft to minimize thermal emissions that would affect its IR detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electronic Detectors\n",
    "For most of history, the human eye was the main tool of an astronomer to identify the stars for rituals, navigation, and agriculture.  [Photographic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate) were developed at the end of the 19th century and became a mainstay for astronomers through much of the 20th century due to there persistence of vision.  Today, the semiconductor device known as the charge-coupled device (CCD) revolutionized the counting of photons  (through process similar to the photoelectric effect).  CCDs are able to detect nearly 100% of the incident photons over a very wide range of wavelengths.  CCDs also have a wide dynamic range, where they can differentiate between very bright and dim objects viewed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CCD works my collecting electrons that are excited into higher energy states (conduction bands) when a detector is struck by a photon.  The number of electrons collected in each pixel is proportional to the image brightness.  HST's Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC 2) has 2.5 million pixels with each pixel capable of holding up to 70,000 electrons.  A very bright target (e.g., $\\alpha$ Cen AB ([Brice-Olivier et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/450/2/2043/981103))) requires a fast shutter so that the pixels don't saturate (i.e., overflow with electrons).\n",
