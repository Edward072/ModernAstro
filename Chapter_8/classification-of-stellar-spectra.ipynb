    "# The Classification of Stellar Spectra\n",
    "The science of astronomy progressed from a purely observational science of classification (prior to the 1800s) to a science interested in the fundamental inner workings of the stars (after the 1800s).  As early as 1817, stars were known to be chemically different through their spectra.\n",

    "## The Formation of Spectral Lines\n",
    "The initial spectral taxonomy used capital letters (from A...Z) that denoted the strength (or broadness) of the hydrogen absorption lines in a star and was developed by Edward Pickering and Williamina Fleming (Pickering's assistant) in the 1890s at Harvard.  Pickering had many assistants working with him at the time, where several of them developed different classification schemes.  Antonia Maury's scheme used the width of the spectral lines, which would have rearranged the Pickering's B stars to come before the A stars.  Building on Maury's work, Annie Jump Cannon rearranged the sequence of spectra so that O stars came before B and A stars, added subdivisions (e.g., A0-A9), and consolidated many of the classes.  As a result, the Harvard classification scheme became a *temperature* sequence with seven [spectral types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification) (OBAFGKM) with O stars being the hottest.  Due to the reordering of letters, astronomy students developed mnemonics to remember the string of spectral types.  The traditional mnemonic and some other memorable versions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O**h **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl/uy, **K**iss **M**e.\n",
    "- **O**ld, **B**ald, **A**nd **F**at **G**enerals **K**eep **M**istresses.\n",
    "- **O**h **B**oy, **A**n **F** **G**rade **K**ills **M**e.\n",
    "- **O**nly **B**oring, **A**stronomers **F**ind **G**ratitude **K**nowing **M**nemonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars near the beginning of a given spectral type are referred to as **early-type** stars (e.g., A0), where those closer to the end are called **late-type** (e.g., A9).  Cannon classified around 200,000 spectra, where the results were collected into the [Henry Draper Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper_Catalogue).  The catalog bears the name of Henry Draper because he was one of the first to photograph and classify a star based on its spectral lines (e.g., Vega), and Pickering supervised photographic spectroscopy at Harvard College Observatory after Draper's death.  Draper's widow funded Pickering's research under the Henry Draper Memorial.  today many stars are referred to by their HD numbers (e.g., Betelguese is HD 39801).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we now know that Cannon's classification scheme is based on surface temperatures, the physical basis of the Harvard spectral classification remained obscure to those who developed it.  Vega (A0) displays very strong hydrogen absorption lines compared to the Sun (G2), but the Sun has stronger calcium absorption lines.  This apparent dichotomy led to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is this a result of a *compositional* difference between the stars?\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the different *surface temperatures* responsible for the relative strengths of the absorption lines?\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical understanding of the quantum atom unlocked the secrets to stellar spectra.  Absorption lines are created when an atom absorbs a photon with *exactly* the energy required for an electron to make an upward transition between energy levels.  Emission lines are formed by the inverse process.  The distinction between spectra of stars with different temperatures are due to the electrons occupying different atomic orbitals in the *atmospheres* of these stars.  The details of spectral lines are complicated by the potential ionization stage of the the atoms.  *Note: an atom's ionization stage is denoted by a Roman numeral (e.g., Ca II is singly ionized calcium).*\n",

    "In Cannon's classification scheme, the Balmer lines (hydrogen absorption) reach their maximum intensity when the effective surface temperature of the star reaches 10,000 K.  The visible neutral Helium (He I) lines occur at 22,000 K (B2 stars) and singly ionized calcium (Ca II) are most intense at 5250 K (K0 stars).  In astronomy, spectral lines of Ca II H and K are quoted, which are 396.8 nm and 393.3 nm, respectively.  Also, astronomers use the term **metal** to refer to a chemical element heavier than helium because hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the universe. Table 1 includes the traditional Harvard classification scheme and the spectral types of very cool stars (L-Type) and [brown dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_T:_methane_dwarfs) (T-Type).  Brown dwarfs are objects with too lite mass for nuclear fusion (of hydrogen) to occur in their interiors and are not considered stars.  Figure 1 illustrates how the spectra appear for a range of spectral classes (falsely colored).  Figure 2 demonstrates the resultant spectra after analysis and digitization.\n",
