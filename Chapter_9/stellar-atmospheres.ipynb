A similar procedure can be used to define the intensity of a cone of light.  The light is measured in spherical coordinates by the angle $\\theta$, which is the direction perpendicular to the surface $dA$ so that $dA\\cos\\theta$ is an area projected onto a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light.  The light energy is wavelength dependent ($E = hc/\\lambda$) and thus can be defined as\n",

    "### General Sources of Opacity\n",
    "The opacity of a material depends on the chemical composition and how photons interact with the particles (atoms, ions, and free electrons) within the material.  If a photon passes within $\\sigma_\\lambda$ (i.e., the particles's cross-sectional area) of the particle, then the phone can be either: scattered or absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an absorption process, the photon ceases to exist and its energy is incorporated into the thermal energy of the gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a scattering process, the photon just continues along in a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both absorption and scattering can remove photons (of a specific wavelength) like a sieve and contribute to the opacity $\\kappa_\\lambda$ of the stellar material.  If the opacity varies slowly with wavelength, it contributes to the star's continuous spectrum (or *continuum*) and dark absorption lines are the result of a *rapid* variation in the opacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four primary sources of opacity available for removing photons from our observations of a star.  These sources involve the quantum state of an electron, where the terms *bound* and *free* are used to describe the initial and final states of the electron within an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bound-bound transitions** are electron transitions from one orbital to another (i.e., excitation and de-excitation).  The bound-bound opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bb}$    accounts for electrons that remove photons through absorption and the re-emission of the photons are scattered into a different direction than the line-of-sight.  This opacity is small except at wavelengths capable of absorption and hence is responsible for absorption lines in stellar spectra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The de-excitation may also come from collisions with neighboring particles.  An important by-product is the degrading of the average energy of the photons.  For example, if two photons are emitted (from a cascade process) for every photon absorbed, then the average energy is cut in half.  There is not simple equation for bound-bound transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bound-free absorption**, or *photoionization*, occurs when an incoming photon has enough energy to free, or ionize, an atom.  The free electron can have any energy when removed from the atom, but the incoming photon must have a wavelength $\\lambda \\leq hc/\\chi_n$, where $\\chi_n$ is the ionization energy of the $n{\\rm th}$ orbital.  The bound-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bf}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The photoionization cross section for the hydrogen atom is  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "    which depends on the quantum state $n$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$.  The inverse process of *free-bound* emission occurs during atomic recombination (free electron recombines with an ion, emitting a photon).  Similar to bound-bound emission, this also reduces the average energy of the photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Free-free absorption** is a scattering process that occurs when the speed of a free electron increases (or decreases) after a nearby ion absorbs (or emits) a photon, respectively.  This process occurs due to conservation of both energy and momentum.  The free-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,ff}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.  The process of free-free emission is also known as [bremsstrahlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung), when means \"braking radiation\" in German.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "4. **Electron scattering** is as you would expect where a photon is scatter (*not absorbed*) by a free electron through the process of [Thomson scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering).  The electron \"oscillates\" (like a buoy) in the wake of a photon.  Because the electron's cross section is tiny, it is a poor target for an incident photon.  The cross section for Thomson scattering $\\sigma_T$ has the same value (independent of wavelength),  <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\begin{align} \\sigma_T = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\epsilon_o^2}\\left( \\frac{e^2}{m_e c^2}\\right) = 6.65 \\times 10^{-29}\\:{\\rm m^2}. \\end{align} \n",
    "\n",
    "    This is ~2 billion times smaller than the hydrogen cross section for photoionization from bound-free absorption, $\\sigma_{bf}$.  Electron scattering is most effective when the electron density is very high (i.e., high temperatures for ionization) and other sources of opacity are eliminated due to the absence of necessary bound electrons.  For high temperatures, the electron scattering opacity $\\kappa_{es}$ dominates the continuum opacity. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    A photon can also be scattered by loosely bound electrons.  *Compton scattering* occurs when the photon's wavelength is much smaller than the atom or *Rayleigh scattering* if the wavelength is much larger.  Compton scatter is usually lumped together with Thomson scattering due to the small change in wavelength of the scattered photon.  The cross section for Rayleigh scattering is smaller than the Thomson cross section and can be neglected in most stellar atmospheres.  However, it is important in the UV for supergiant stars with their extended envelopes and in cool main-sequence stars.\n",
    "    The opacity of stellar material suddenly increases at wavelengths $\\lambda \\leq 364.7\\:{\\rm nm}$ and the measured radiative flux of the star suddenly decreases.  This abrupt drop in the continuous spectrum is the **Balmer jump** and is evident in the Sun's spectrum.  The size of the Balmer jump in hot stars depends on the fraction of hydrogen atoms in the first excited state.  The Balmer jump appears in the middle of the *U* band in the *UBV* system, which results in a decrease in the amount of light received in the bandwidth of the *U* filter and increase the measured values for both the *U* magnitude and color index ($U-B$).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **$H^-$ ion photoionization** occurs in the atmospheres of stars later than F0 and is the primary source of continuum opacity, $\\kappa_{H^-}$.  An $H^-$ ion is a hydrogen atom with a second electron, where there is partial shielding provided by the nucleus (to prevent repulsion) and thus the second electron can be loosely bound on the opposite side of the atom.  The binding energy (0.754 eV) is small compared with the binding energy of the hydrogen atom from the ground state.  The electron is easily liberated by photons with energy greater than 0.754 eV, where the excess energy is converted to kinetic energy.  On the other hand, a hydrogen atom can also capture a second electron and release a photon (proportional to the excess kinetic energy of the captured electron) in the process (i.e., $H+e^- \\rightleftharpoons H^- + \\gamma$).  A photon with an energy equal to 0.754 eV corresponds to a wavelength of 1640 nm.  At longer wavelengths $H^-$ contributes to opacity through free-free absorption (i.e., more free electrons become available through photoionization).\n",

It is often useful to define an opacity that has been averaged over all wavelengths.  This averaging produces an opacity that depends only on the composition, density, and temperature of the stellar atmosphere.  The most commonly used scheme to compute a wavelength-independent opacity is the [Rosseland mean opacity](http://personal.psu.edu/rbc3/A534/lec6.pdf) or the **Rosseland mean**.  The Rosseland mean incorporates a weighting function that depends on how fast the blackbody spectrum varies with temperature, which is defined as\n",

This means that the mechanisms involved in absorbing and emitting energy must be in balance throughout the star so that no change in total energy occurs within any layer of the interior.

Opacity described processes (bound-bound and free-bound) that absorb photons, where there is an inverse process through emission (e.g., bound-bound emission, etc.).  The processes of absorption and emission hinder the flow of photons through a star and there is not a direct flow of photons streaming towards the surface.

Our goal is to determine $N_a$ using the calculated and observed line profiles.  Quantum mechanics is used to determine the likelihood of transitions and the relative probabilities of an electron making a transition are given by *f-values* or *oscillator strengths*.  For hydrogen, $f=0.637$ for ${\\rm H \\alpha}$ and $f=0.119$ for ${\\rm H\\beta}$.  The oscillator strength may be numerically or experimentally determined, where they are defined so that the *f-values* for transitions (from the same initial orbital) add up to the number of electrons in the atom or ion.  *The oscillator strength is the product of $N_a$ and the f-value.* \n",

    "The **curve of growth** helps determine the value of $N_a$ and the abundances of elements in stellar atmospheres.  Since the equivalent width $W$ varies with $N_a$, a curve of growth represents the logarithmic change in both quantities.  When an absorbing element is introduced it produces absorption lines that are linearly proportional to $N_a$, until a saturation point is reached and the core line is optically thick.  The wings are still optically thin and can deepen, so the curve of growth increases proportional to $\\sqrt{\\ln N_a}$.  For large numbers of absorbing atoms, the pressure broadening contributes to deepening the wings and the absorption width grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{N_a}$.  Using the curve of growth and a measured equivalent width, we can obtain the number of absorbing atoms.\n",

However this in not applicable for all broad lines (e.g., H) and may lead to inaccurate results.  A logarithmic plot of the equivalent width per wavelength versus the *f*-value of the Number of atoms as a function of wavelength (normalized relative to 500 nm) provides this alternative view of the curve of growth (see Figure {numref}`{number}<solar-growth-fig>`).\n",

    "The number of absorbing atoms can be determined by comparing the measured equivalent widths for different absorption lines with a theoretical curve of growth.  A similar analysis can be performed for lines originating from atoms (or ions) in different initial states, where the Boltzmann equation is applied to the relative numbers of atoms (or ions) to calculate the excitation temperature.  It also possible to use the Saha equation to find either the electron pressure of the ionization temperature."

    "The ultimate refinement in analyzing stellar atmospheres comes from the construction of a *model atmosphere* on a computer.  Each of the parameters that we use (temperature, pressure, and density) depend on each other in complex ways.  Each atmospheric layer is involved in the formation of line profiles that contribute to the observed stellar spectrum.  The equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, thermodynamics, statistical and quantum mechanics, and energy transport (by radiation and convection) are combined with extensive libraries of opacities to calculate the temperature, pressure, and density as a function of depth below the surface.\n",
