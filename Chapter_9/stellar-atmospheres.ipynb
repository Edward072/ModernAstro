    "### General Sources of Opacity\n",
    "The opacity of a material depends on the chemical composition and how photons interact with the particles (atoms, ions, and free electrons) within the material.  If a photon passes within $\\sigma_\\lambda$ (i.e., the particles's cross-sectional area) of the particle, then the phone can be either: scattered or absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an absorption process, the photon ceases to exist and its energy is incorporated into the thermal energy of the gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a scattering process, the photon just continues along in a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both absorption and scattering can remove photons (of a specific wavelength) like a sieve and contribute to the opacity $\\kappa_\\lambda$ of the stellar material.  If the opacity varies slowly with wavelength, it contributes to the star's continuous spectrum (or *continuum*) and dark absorption lines are the result of a *rapid* variation in the opacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four primary sources of opacity available for removing photons from our observations of a star.  These sources involve the quantum state of an electron, where the terms *bound* and *free* are used to describe the initial and final states of the electron within an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **Bound-bound transitions** are electron transitions from one orbital to another (i.e., excitation and de-excitation).  The bound-bound opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bb}$ accounts for electrons that remove photons through absorption and the re-emission of the photons are scattered into a different direction than the line-of-sight.  This opacity is small except at wavelengths capable of absorption and hence is responsible for absorption lines in stellar spectra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The de-excitation may also come from collisions with neighboring particles.  An important by-product is the degrading of the average energy of the photons.  For example, if two photons are emitted (from a cascade process) for every photon absorbed, then the average energy is cut in half.  There is not simple equation for bound-bound transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Bound-free absorption**, or *photoionization*, occurs when an incoming photon has enough energy to free, or ionize, an atom.  The free electron can have any energy when removed from the atom, but the incoming photon must have a wavelength $\\lambda \\leq hc/\\chi_n$, where $\\chi_n$ is the ionization energy of the $n{\\rm th}$ orbital.  The bound-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bf}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.\n",

    "3\\. **Free-free absorption** is a scattering process that occurs when the speed of a free electron increases (or decreases) after a nearby ion absorbs (or emits) a photon, respectively.  This process occurs due to conservation of both energy and momentum.  The free-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,ff}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.

The electron is easily liberated by photons with energy greater than 0.754 eV, where the excess energy is converted to kinetic energy.

    "An observer looking at the Sun's disk sees the brightest (hottest) portion near the center due to optical depth ($\\tau_\\lambda = 2/3$), observations near the edge (or *limb*) of the Sun appear darker (cooler).  The optical depth limits how deep an observer can see into the Sun, where at the center a finite depth reaches the hotter inner layers that glow more brightly.  At the limb, the penetration depth only reaches the uppermost (cooler) layers of the atmosphere and we will see a lower temperature compared to the center of the disk.  This effect is called **limb darkening**, where astronomers have to account for it in transit photometry (e.g., binary stars and [exoplanets](https://www.paulanthonywilson.com/exoplanets/exoplanet-detection-techniques/the-exoplanet-transit-method/)).\n",

In the analogy of the closed room, a net flow of air (i.e., breeze) can occur after opening a window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure outside is lower than the pressure inside the room, which can be expressed as a pressure differential using Bernoulli's principle.  In a star, the high pressure interior and vacuum of space also produces a pressure difference.  The extent of the difference is not uniform, where the pressure decreases with stellar radius (i.e., as you get closer to the surface).

    "## The Transfer Equation\n",
    "### The Emission Coefficient\n",
    "When examining the transfer of radiation, we are interested in the net flow of energy, not the specific path taken by individual photons. The intensity of light (i.e., change in flow) can be increased through the emission process as a ray travels through a gas.  The change in intensity $dI_\\lambda$ is proportional to the distance traveled $ds$ and the density of the gas $\\rho$.  Pure emission is described by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dI_\\lambda = j_\\lambda \\rho ds, \\tag{29}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $j_\\lambda$ is the wavelength-dependent **emission coefficient** of the gas in units of ${\\rm m/s^3/sr}$.  Unlike the definition for the absorption coefficient, the contribution due to emission does not depend on $I_\\lambda$ and thus the emission coefficient $j_\\lambda$ has different units than the absorption coefficient $\\kappa_\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific intensity $I_\\lambda$ of a beam changes as photons are added (emission or scattering into) or removed (absorption or scattering out) from the beam. Combining the contributions from both absorption and emission gives the general result\n",

    "The competing processes (in Eqn. 30) determine the changes in the beam intensity.  Imagine an interstate highway, where there is a flow of cars in one direction.  Due to the placement of on- and off-ramps, the total number of cars can increase or decrease over time.  The instantaneous changes in the flow of cars onto/off-off the highway affect the net flow of cars, where a large influx can lead to a traffic jam.\n",

    "### The Source Function and the Transfer Equation\n",
    "In a stellar atmosphere or interior, photons are added or removed from a net flow of radiation and we observe the net result.  The ratio of emission and absorption rates determine how rapidly the beam intensity changes and the tendency for a specific wavelength of photon to dominate the local population.  To determine the ratio of emission to absorption ($j_\\lambda/\\kappa_\\lambda$), or **source function** $S_\\lambda$ , we divide Eqn. 30 by $-\\kappa_\\lambda \\rho ds$:\n",
    "\n",

    "The source function has the same units of intensity (${\\rm W/m^3/sr}$) and is one form of the **equation of radiative transfer** or **transfer equation**.  According to the transfer equation, the intensity of light will not vary if $dI_\\lambda/ds = 0$ and $I_\\lambda = S_\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This form of the transfer equation assumes that the atmosphere is in a steady state.  Otherwise, a time-derivative term would have to be included.  Recall the definition of $S_\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to $\\kappa_\\lambda$ so that the source function \"blows up\" as $\\kappa_\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$.  In this case, Equation 29 should be used instead.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the intensity is *greater* than the source function ($I_\\lambda > S_\\lambda$), then the intensity of light decreases with distance (i.e., more absorption than emission).  On the other hand, if the intensity is *less** than the source function ($I_\\lambda < S_\\lambda$), then the intensity increases with distance (i.e., more emission than absorption).  This is a mathematical restatement of: *the intensity of the light tends to become equal to the local value of the source function*."

    "### The Special Case of Blackbody Radiation\n",
    "Consider a box containing an optically thick gas maintained at a constant temperature $T$. The confined particles and blackbody radiation are in thermodynamic equilibrium by definition because there isn't a flow of energy through the box or between the gas particles.  A consequence of this equilibrium is that every process of absorption is met with an inverse process of emission.  The intensity of the radiation is described by the Planck function $I_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$ and the variation of intensity goes to zero, $dI_\\lambda/ds = 0$ and $S_\\lambda = I_\\lambda$.  Using the transitive property ($A=B$, $B=C$, and therefore $A=C$) and *thermodynamic equilibrium*, *the source function is equal to the Planck function*, $S_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A star cannot be in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium because there is a net flow of energy from the center to the surface.  But deep the in atmosphere (or a large optical depth, $\\tau_\\lambda \\gg 1$), a random-walking photon (with many scattering events) will take at least $\\tau_\\lambda^2$ steps (Eqn. 27) to reach the surface.  When the photon mean free path is small compared to temperature scale height, the photons are *effectively* confined to a volume of nearly constant temperature and the conditions for local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are satisfied.  Overall the statements: **(a)** $I_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$ and **(b)** $S_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$ indicate that the radiation field is described by the Planck function and the source function describes the physical source of the radiation ($j_\\lambda/\\kappa_\\lambda$) as one that produces the radiation.\n",

    "### The Assumption of a Plane-Parallel Atmosphere\n",
    "The intensity of light must depend on the path for the outward flow of energy.  The absorption and emission coefficients are the same for light traveling in all directions, but these coefficients depend on the temperature and density in a complicated way.  For astronomers to understand the stellar interior, they must know *at what depth* a spectral line is formed.  Since we are interested in the depth, let's rewrite the transfer equation in terms of the optical depth, which is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI_\\lambda}{d\\tau_\\lambda} = I_\\lambda - S_\\lambda. \\tag{33} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical depth does not provide a unique geometric depth in the atmosphere and thus, must be replaced with a more meaningful measure of position.  The atmospheres of main-sequence stars are physically thin compared with the size of the star.  The atmosphere's radius of curvature is much larger than its thickness, where we may consider the atmosphere as a *plane-parallel slab*.  If we assume align the *z*-axis with the vertical direction, then $z=0$ denotes the top of this **plane-parallel** atmosphere and a **vertical optical depth** $\\tau_{\\lambda,v}(z)$ is defined as\n",

Quantum mechanics is used to determine the likelihood of transitions and the relative probabilities of an electron making a transition are given by *f-values* or *oscillator strengths*.  For hydrogen, $f=0.637$ for ${\\rm H \\alpha}$ and $f=0.119$ for ${\\rm H\\beta}$.

    "The **curve of growth** helps determine the value of $N_a$ and the abundances of elements in stellar atmospheres.  Since the equivalent width $W$ varies with $N_a$, a curve of growth represents the logarithmic change in both quantities.  When an absorbing element is introduced it produces absorption lines that are linearly proportional to $N_a$, until a saturation point is reached and the core line is optically thick.  The wings are still optically thin and can deepen, so the curve of growth increases proportional to $\\sqrt{\\ln N_a}$.  For large numbers of absorbing atoms, the pressure broadening contributes to deepening the wings and the absorption width grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{N_a}$.  Using the curve of growth and a measured equivalent width, we can obtain the number of absorbing atoms.\n",

    "To reduce the errors involved in a single spectral line, it is advantageous to locate (on a single curve of growth) the positions of equivalent widths of several lines formed by transitions from the same initial orbital.  However this in not applicable for all broad lines (e.g., H) and may lead to inaccurate results.  A logarithmic plot of the equivalent width per wavelength versus the *f*-value of the Number of atoms as a function of wavelength (normalized relative to 500 nm) provides this alternative view of the curve of growth (see Figure 20).\n",
