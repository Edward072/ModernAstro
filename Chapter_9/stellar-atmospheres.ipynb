A similar procedure can be used to define the intensity of a cone of light.  The light is measured in spherical coordinates by the angle $\\theta$, which is the direction perpendicular to the surface $dA$ so that $dA\\cos\\theta$ is an area projected onto a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light.  The light energy is wavelength dependent ($E = hc/\\lambda$) and thus can be defined as\n",

    "## Stellar Opacity\n",
    "The classification of stellar spectra is complicated by the fact that stars are not actually blackbodies.  The temperature of a star's photosphere can be estimated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the spectrum shape using the Planck function.  However, the Sun's spectrum deviates substantially from the idealized shape because solar absorption lines remove light at certain wavelengths.  A dense series of metallic absorption lines in the Solar spectrum is especially effective and called **line blanketing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n",
    "There are many different measures of temperature within a star, which are defined according to a particular physical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The temperature obtained from the Stefan-Boltzmann law (**effective temperature**) is *uniquely defined for a particular layer* of the stellar atmosphere.\n",
    "- The **excitation temperature** is defined by the Boltzmann equation, which measures the ratio of atoms between two quantum states.\n",
    "- The **ionization temperature** is defined by the Saha equation, which measures the ratio of atoms that are ionized (missing electrons).\n",
    "- The **kinetic temperature** is contained in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which describes the velocity distribution of gas particles.\n",
    "- The **color temperature** is obtained by fitting the Planck function to the shape of a star's continuous spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective temperature is the only measure that depends strictly on the location within the star, while the remaining temperatures vary according to the conditions of the gas that can be described by the simple case of a gas confined within an \"ideal\" box (i.e., ideal gas law).  Due to the boundary condition of the box, the energy of the gas particles and blackbody radiation will come into equilibrium and can be described by a single well-defined temperature.  As a result, there is no net flow of energy through the box, or between the matter and radiation.  The number of photons absorbed per unit time is equal to the number of photons emitted, which is called [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium).\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a case cannot be true everywhere in a star (i.e., stars shine so some photons escape) and a star cannot be in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium.  A net outward flow of energy occurs through the star and the temperature varies with the stellar radius.  The ideal box approximation can be used: *if the distance over which the temperature changes significantly is large compared with the distances traveled by the particles and photons between collisions* (i.e., the ideal box is small enough).  The distances traveled by particles are called their *mean free paths*.  When the above condition is met, the particles and photons cannot escape the local environment and the temperature of the box is nearly constant (i.e., **local thermodynamic equilibrium** *LTE*).\n",

    "### General Sources of Opacity\n",
    "The opacity of a material depends on the chemical composition and how photons interact with the particles (atoms, ions, and free electrons) within the material.  If a photon passes within $\\sigma_\\lambda$ (i.e., the particles's cross-sectional area) of the particle, then the phone can be either: scattered or absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an absorption process, the photon ceases to exist and its energy is incorporated into the thermal energy of the gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a scattering process, the photon just continues along in a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both absorption and scattering can remove photons (of a specific wavelength) like a sieve and contribute to the opacity $\\kappa_\\lambda$ of the stellar material.  If the opacity varies slowly with wavelength, it contributes to the star's continuous spectrum (or *continuum*) and dark absorption lines are the result of a *rapid* variation in the opacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four primary sources of opacity available for removing photons from our observations of a star.  These sources involve the quantum state of an electron, where the terms *bound* and *free* are used to describe the initial and final states of the electron within an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **Bound-bound transitions** are electron transitions from one orbital to another (i.e., excitation and de-excitation).  The bound-bound opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bb}$ accounts for electrons that remove photons through absorption and the re-emission of the photons are scattered into a different direction than the line-of-sight.  This opacity is small except at wavelengths capable of absorption and hence is responsible for absorption lines in stellar spectra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The de-excitation may also come from collisions with neighboring particles.  An important by-product is the degrading of the average energy of the photons.  For example, if two photons are emitted (from a cascade process) for every photon absorbed, then the average energy is cut in half.  There is not simple equation for bound-bound transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Bound-free absorption**, or *photoionization*, occurs when an incoming photon has enough energy to free, or ionize, an atom.  The free electron can have any energy when removed from the atom, but the incoming photon must have a wavelength $\\lambda \\leq hc/\\chi_n$, where $\\chi_n$ is the ionization energy of the $n{\\rm th}$ orbital.  The bound-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,bf}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.\n",

    "which depends on the quantum state $n$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$.  The inverse process of *free-bound* emission occurs during atomic recombination (free electron recombines with an ion, emitting a photon).  Similar to bound-bound emission, this also reduces the average energy of the photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Free-free absorption** is a scattering process that occurs when the speed of a free electron increases (or decreases) after a nearby ion absorbs (or emits) a photon, respectively.  This process occurs due to conservation of both energy and momentum.  The free-free opacity $\\kappa_{\\lambda,ff}$ contributes to the continuum opacity.  The process of free-free emission is also known as [bremsstrahlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung), when means \"braking radiation\" in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **Electron scattering** is as you would expect where a photon is scatter (*not absorbed*) by a free electron through the process of [Thomas scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering).  The electron \"oscillates\" (like a buoy) in the wake of a photon.  Because the electron's cross section is tiny, it is a poor target for an incident photon.  The cross section for Thomson scattering $\\sigma_T$ has the same value (independent of wavelength),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_T = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\epsilon_o^2}\\left( \\frac{e^2}{m_e c^2}\\right) = 6.65 \\times 10^{-29}\\:{\\rm m^2}.  \\tag{17} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ~2 billion times smaller than the hydrogen cross section for photoionization from bound-free absorption, $\\sigma_{bf}$.  Electron scattering is most effective when the electron density is very high (i.e., high temperatures for ionization) and other sources of opacity are eliminated due to the absence of necessary bound electrons.  For high temperatures, the electron scattering opacity $\\kappa_{es}$ dominates the continuum opacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A photon can also be scattered by loosely bound electrons.  *Compton scattering* occurs when the photon's wavelength is much smaller than the atom or *Rayleigh scattering* if the wavelength is much larger.  Compton scatter is usually lumped together with Thomson scattering due to the small change in wavelength of the scattered photon.  The cross section for Rayleigh scattering is smaller than the the Thomson cross section and can be neglected in most stellar atmospheres.  However, it is important in the UV for supergiant stars with their extended envelopes and in cool main-sequence stars.\n",

The electron is easily liberated by photons with energy greater than 0.754 eV, where the excess energy is converted to kinetic energy.
