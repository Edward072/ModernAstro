<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.1. </span>The Evolutionary History of the Sun<a class="headerlink" href="#the-evolutionary-history-of-the-sun" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our Sun is classified as a typical main-sequence star of spectral class G2, which contains mostly hydrogen <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((X=0.74)\)</span>, some helium <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((Y=0.24)\)</span>, and a little metal (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z=0.02)\)</span> by mass.  The composition has changed (evolved) over time because it has been converting hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain for most of its lifetime.  Even though the Sun is changing over time, we can still estimate its age using other bodies of the Solar System.  For example, radioactive dating of Moon rocks and meteorites indicate that they are ~4.57 Gyr old and the Sun would be <em>at least</em> as old as these rocks.  Since becoming a main-sequence star, the Sun’s luminosity has increased by nearly 48% and its radius has increased by 15%, which lead to an increase a 2.7% increase in its effective temperature.  The effect of this luminosity increase on the Earth is unclear due to the Earth’s time-varying ability to reflect light through its albedo (caused by surface water and ice).</p>

<p>Radioactive dating of the oldest known objects in the Solar System, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium%E2%80%93aluminium-rich_inclusion">calcium-aluminum inclusions</a> (CAIs), indicates that the age of the Solar System is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.56730 \pm 0.00016\)</span> Gyr, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4567.30 \pm 0.16\)</span> Myr.</p>

<p>Using the current age of the Sun, a <strong>solar model</strong> must reproduce the current values of the central temperature, pressure, density, and composition.  A schematic of the Sun can be constructed, where an inner core produces the radiation through nuclear reactions, a middle layer transports the energy through radiation, and an outer atmosphere brings energy to the surface through convection cells of rising and sinking gas.  Using such a model, the hydrogen mass fraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((X)\)</span> <em>in the core</em> has decreased from 0.71 to 0.34 and the helium mass fraction increased from 0.27 to 0.64 over the Sun’s lifetime.  <em>At the surface</em> the hydrogen mass fraction increased by 0.03, while the helium mass fraction decreased by 0.03.</p>

<p>Evolution of the Sun’s interior includes ongoing nucleosynthesis, surface convection, and elemental diffusion (settling of heavier elements).  The Sun’s primary energy production comes from the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain">proton-proton (pp)</a> chain, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3{\rm He}\)</span>, or <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium">tritium</a> is an intermediate species in the reaction sequence.  Tritium can be produced and destroyed as part of the conversion of hydrogen into helium.  However, tritium is relatively more abundant at the top of the hydrogen-burning region where the temperature is lower.  At greater depths, the higher temperatures the destroy the tritium more often than it is created, resulting in a overall decrease in abundance.  The production of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^4{\rm He}\)</span> (stable helium) decreases and hydrogen increases slightly near 0.7 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm R_\odot}\)</span> due to the surface convection zone and elemental diffusion.</p>

<p>Models of stellar structure and the derivation of fundamental physical principles have uncovered an enormous amount of information regarding the Sun’s interior.  A complete and reasonable model needs to be consistent with evolutionary timescales and the global characteristics (e.g., mass, luminosity, radius, effective temperature, surface composition, and oscillation frequencies).  However there is one aspect of the Sun where the observations don’t match the theoretical model, which is the abundance of lithium.  The observed lithium abundance is somewhat less than expected, which may imply that some adjustments (e.g., through convection, rotation, and/or mass loss) to the model are necessary.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.3. </span>The Solar Neutrino Problem: A Detective Story Solved<a class="headerlink" href="#the-solar-neutrino-problem-a-detective-story-solved" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For decades, there was an inconsistency between the observations of the Sun and the model, where the solution resulting in an important new understanding of fundamental physics.  In 1970, Raymond  Davis began measuring the neutrino flux from the Sun.  His detector was located almost 1 mile below ground within a gold mine in Lead, South Dakota.  The neutrino has a very low cross section for interaction with other matter, which makes it difficult to detect.  <em>Like the eye of Sauron</em>, neutrinos penetrate where other particles cannot.  The detector was placed underground to lower the background noise and ensure that it was only measuring neutrinos.</p>
<p>The neutrino detector contained ~100,000 gallons of cleaning fluid, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm C_2Cl_4}\)</span> (tetrachloroethylene), because chlorine interacts with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}\)</span> to produce <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm ^{37}_{18}Ar}\)</span> that has a half-life of 35 days,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ {\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl} + \nu_e \rightleftharpoons {\rm ^{37}_{18}Ar} + e^-.\]</div>
<p>The threshold energy for this reaction is 0.814 MeV and less than the energy of the neutrinos produced in almost every step of the pp chain.  The neutrinos in the first step,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ {\rm ^1_1H} + {\rm ^1_1H} \rightarrow {\rm ^2_1H} + e^+ + \nu_{e^-}, \]</div>
<p>produced more energy, but the reaction that accounted for 77% of the neutrinos detected is the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm ^8_5 B}\)</span> into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm ^8_4Be}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ {\rm ^8_5B} \rightarrow {\rm ^8_4Be} + e^+ + \nu_e. \]</div>
<p>Unfortunately, this reaction is very rare (1:5000).  Every few months, Davis and his collaborators purged the accumulated argon and determined the number of argon atoms produced.  The capture rate was measured using the <strong>solar neutrino unit</strong>, where 1 SNU equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-36}\)</span> reactions per target atom per second.  The tank contained <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim10^{30}\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}\)</span> atoms, which corresponds to 5.35 SNU if only 1 argon atom was produced each day.</p>
<p>John Bahcall computed the anticipated capture rate of 7.9 SNU, while the actual data (taken between 1970 and 1994) yielded an average of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.56 \pm 0.16\)</span> SNU.  About one-third of the expected yield.  Other experiments have confirmed the discrepancy including Japan’s underground Super-Kamiokande observatory.  This observatory detects the <strong>Cerenkov light</strong> produced when neutrinos scatter electrons.  Through this measurement only half of the neutrinos are detected compared to the predictions from solar models.</p>
<p>The deficit of neutrinos suggested that either <strong>(a)</strong> some fundamental physical process in the solar model is incorrect or <strong>(b)</strong> something happens to the neutrinos in-transit (i.e., on their way from the Sun’s core to the Earth).  The <strong>Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein</strong> (or MSW) effect involves transformation of neutrinos between the three types (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_\mu\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_\tau\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_e\)</span>).  This idea is an extension of the <em>electroweak theory</em>* fof particle physics.</p>
<p>Confirmation of this idea came in 1998 when Super-Kamiokande was used to detect <em>atmospheric neutrinos</em> produced in Earth’s upper atmosphere.  Cosmic rays are capable of producing only electron and muon neutrinos.  Super-Kamiokande determined that the number of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu_\mu\)</span> traveling upward was significantly reduced compared to those traveling downward, where the difference in numbers is in excellent agreement with the theory of neutrino mixing.  For neutrino mixing to occur, the neutrino could not be a massless particle and the experiment confirmed this as well.  After several decades the solar neutrino problem was resolved by a profound advance in our understanding of particle physics.</p>

<p>Optical photons appear to originate from an outer layer of the Sun called the <strong>photosphere</strong>.  The base of the photosphere is somewhat arbitrary since photons because some photons originate from deep within the Sun (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda \gg 1\)</span>).  The optical depth from a given layer <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda\)</span> can be estimated from an estimate of the fraction of photons that we receive from that layer (i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_\lambda = -\ln\left(I_\lambda/I_{\lambda,o}\right)\)</span>).  For instance, if 1% of the photons from a given layer, then the optical depth is approximately 4.6.  The opacity and optical depth are wavelength-dependent, where the base of the photosphere is also wavelength dependent if it is defined in terms of the optical depth.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Given the arbitrariness of the definition, the photosphere’s base is sometimes simply defined as 100 km below <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_1\)</span>, the level where the optical depth at 500 nm is unity:</p>

On average, the solar flus is emitted from and optical depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau = 2/3\)</span> (<a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_9/stellar-atmospheres.html#the-eddington-approximation">the Eddington approximation</a>), which leads to defining the effective temperature (for <a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#the-connection-between-color-and-temperature">Wien’s law</a>) at this depth.</p>
<p>A source of opacity exists and is continuous across wavelength due in part to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^-\)</span> ions in the photosphere.  Using the <a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_8/classification-of-stellar-spectra.html#the-saha-equation">Saha equation</a>, we can determine the ratio of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^-\)</span> ions to the neutral hydrogen atoms.  The abundance of H II <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((H^-\:{\rm ions})\)</span> in the Sun is actually quite low (1 in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^7\)</span> atoms), but it becomes important because neutral hydrogen is not capable of contributing significantly to the continuum.</p>
<p>An individual spectral line is not infinitesimally thin covering a range of wavelengths and different parts of the same line can originate form at different depths of the solar atmosphere.  The absorption lines (e.g., Fraunhofer lines) are produced in the photosphere.</p>
<p>From Kirchoff’s laws, the absorption lines are produced when there is a cooler gas between the observer and the bulk of the hot source (i.e., continuum-forming region).  In reality, the Fraunhofer lines are formed in the same layers where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^-\)</span> ions produce the continuum.  The center of an absorption line originates from the regions of lower optical depth (i.e., higher in the photosphere) where the gas is cooler because the opacity is greatest at the center of the line (i.e., more difficult to see deeper in the atmosphere).  Moving into the wings of the line, the opacity decreases and this implies that absorption is occurring at progressively deeper levels.  At wavelengths far from the central line, the absorption is negligible and the continuum is observed.</p>

<p>Observations of the photosphere show a patchwork of bright and dark regions evolve over time, where the dark regions can appear and then disappear.  The spatial extent of a region can be 700 km and have a lifetime for 5-10 minutes.  This structure is called <strong>granulation</strong> and represents the top portion of a convection zone protruding into the photosphere’s base.  Granulation causes wiggles to appear in the absorption lines due to small Doppler shifts (400 m/s) from the convection cycle.  The brighter regions produce blueshifts (i.e., rising hot material) in the absorption lines while the darker regions are caused by redshifts (i.e., sinking cool material).  The lifetime of a granule is defined as the amount of time for a parcel to rise and fall the distance of one mixing length.</p>

<p>The absorption lines are used to measure the rotation rate of the Sun, where measurements are taken from the equator and then outward with increasing latitude.  By measuring Doppler shifts as a function of latitude, we find that the Sun rotates <em>differentially</em> meaning the rotation rate changes with latitude.  The rotation period at the equator is approximately 25 days, while it increases to 36 days at the poles.  The Sun’s rotation also varies internally with radius.  Near the base of the convection zone, differing rotation rates converge into a region known as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachocline">tachocline</a>.  The differing rotation rates produce a strong shear in the atmosphere, which can result in electric currents in the plasma that generate the Sun’s magnetic field.</p>

<p>Above the photosphere lies a portion of the Sun’s atmosphere called the <strong>chromosphere</strong> that is only about 0.01% (or a factor of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-4}\)</span>) of the photosphere’s intensity and extends upward for approximately 1600 km or 2100 km above <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_{500} = 1\)</span>.  The light produced in the chromosphere indicates that the gas density drops dramatically (by a factor of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^4\)</span>) and the temperature begins to increase with altitude, from 4400 K to 10,000 K.  The Boltzmann and Saha equations show that spectral lines can be produced in the low density and high temperature environment of the chromosphere (e.g., He II, Fe II, Si II, Cr II, and Ca II).</p>
<p>Certain Fraunhofer lines appear as absorption lines in the visible and near-UV, where others begin to appear as emission lines at shorter (or much longer) wavelengths.  Kirchoff’s laws suggest that a hot, low-density gas must be responsible for the emission lines.  The emission cannot occur deep within the Sun’s interior because the Sun is optically thick and so the area of emission line production occurs elsewhere.  The strength of the continuum decreases rapidly at shorter and longer wavelengths (far from the peak at 500 nm).  Thus, emission lines produced far from the visible are not overwhelmed by the expected blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>Emission lines (in the visible range) are observable near the limb of the Sun for a few seconds when the bright solar disk is occulted during a total eclipse and is known as a <strong>flash spectrum</strong>.  During an eclipse the Sun gaines a reddish hue because the Balmer <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H\alpha}\)</span> emission line can now dominate.  Alternatively, filters can be used to restrict observations to the wavelengths of emission lines in the chromosphere (particularly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H \alpha}\)</span>) and a great deal of hidden structure becomes visible.  On scales of 30,000 km, the continued effects of the convection zone are seen as <strong>supergranulation</strong>.  Similar to granules, Doppler studies reveal the rising and sinking of gas at 400 km/s.  <strong>Spicules</strong>, or vertical filaments of gas, are present that extend upward for 10,000 km and each spicule has a lifetime of only 15 minutes.  As a result the speed of particles in spicules move upwards at approximately 15 km/s, as shown through Doppler studies.</p>

</div>
<p>The corona is essentially transparent to most EM radiation (except long radio wavelengths) and is <strong>not</strong> in LTE.  For gases that are not in LTE, a unique temperature is not strictly definable. Temperatures obtained by considering thermal motions, ionization levels, and radio emission do give consistent results.  The presence of Fe XIV lines indicates temperatures in excess of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\times 10^6\)</span> K, as do line widths produce by thermal Doppler broadening.  Three structural components exist within the corona:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>K corona</strong> (from <em>Kontinueirlich</em> or “continuous”) produces continuous white light emission that results from photospheric radiation scattered by free electrons.  Contributions from the K corona occur between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-2.3\:R_\odot\)</span> from the Sun’s center.  The spectral lines in the photosphere are essentially blended by the large Doppler shifts that are caused by the high thermal velocities of the electrons.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>F corona</strong> (for Fraunhofer) comes from the scattering of photospheric light by dust and grains beyond <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.3\:R_\odot\)</span>.  Dust grains are more massive (and slower) than electrons, so Doppler broadening is minimal and the Fraunhofer lines are still detectable.  The F corona merges with the fait glow along the ecliptic that is a reflection of sunlight from interplanetary dust and is called <strong>zodiacal light</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>E corona</strong> is the source of the emission lines of highly ionized atoms throughout the corona.  <em>The E corona overlaps the K and F coronas.</em>  The temperatures are extremely high in the corona and the exponential term in the Saha equation encourages ionization.  Very low number densities also encourage ionization since the potential for recombination is reduced.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The low number densities in the corona allow <em>forbidden transitions</em> to occur from atomic energy levels that are <strong>metastable</strong> (or temporarily stable).  Electron do not readily make transitions from metastable states to lower energy states without assistance from another particle.  Spontaneous forbidden transitions have a lifetime of ~1 s, where the allowed transitions have a life time of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-8}\)</span> s.  In high density gases, electrons escape from metastable states through collisions, but collisions are rare in the corona.  Similar to the 21 cm hydrogen spin-flip transition, some electrons will make spontaneous transitions from metastable states to lower energy states given enough time.</p>
<p>The blackbody continuum from the Sun decreases following <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\lambda^4\)</span> for sufficiently long wavelengths (<a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#rayleigh-jeans-and-wien-approximation">Rayleigh-Jeans law</a>) and thus, the amount of photospheric radio emission is negligible.  The corona is a source of radio emission, where some of this emission arises from <em>free-free</em> transitions as electrons pass near ions.  Due to these encounters, the change in energy of the electron determines the wavelength of the resulting photon through conservation of energy.  Encounters in a higher density region (i.e., nearer to the Sun) result in shorter wavelength photons, where encounters in the chromosphere and lower corona (with much lower density) emit longer wavelength radiation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1-20\:{\rm cm})\)</span>.  Synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons also contributes to the radio emission of the corona.</p>
<p>X-ray emissions from the photosphere are also rare, where the blackbody continuum decreases more rapidly (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#rayleigh-jeans-and-wien-approximation">Wien approximation</a>).  Thus, any X-ray emission from the corona overwhelms the contribution from the photosphere due to its high temperature and low opacity at X-ray wavelengths.  The corona contains a high degree of ionization for all the elements present, where the neutral atoms undergo a large number of transitions.  Each element is capable of producing ans extensive emission spectrum.</p>

<p>Observations show that X-ray emission is non-uniform, where active (bright and hot) regions exist along with the <strong>coronal holes</strong> (darker and cooler regions).  Within the coronal holes, localized bright spots (in X-ray wavelengths) can occur over a timescale of several hours.  A weaker X-ray emission coming from the coronal holes is characteristic of the lower density and temperature of the region.</p>
<p>The existence of coronal holes is tied to the Sun’s magnetic field and the generation of a <em>fast</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind">solar wind</a>.  The solar wind consists of a continuous stream of particles escaping from the Sun at speeds of approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(750\:{\rm km/s}\)</span>.  A gusty, <em>slow</em> solar wind (speeds of about half the fast solar wind) is produced by streamers in the corona associated with closed magnetic fields.</p>
<p>The Sun’s magnetic field is similar to a dipole (on a global scale), although its value can differ significantly in localized regions and the field strength is typically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim 10^{-4}\:{\rm T}\)</span> near the surface (or a factor of few larger than Earth’s magnetic field at its surface).  Coronal holes correspond to regions where the magnetic field lines are <em>open</em>, while the X-ray bright regions are associated with <em>closed</em> field lines.  Closed field lines form loops that return to the Sun, while open field lines extend out to great distances.</p>

<p>For charged particles moving in an external magnetic field, the Lorentz force equation applies</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}), \tag{2} \]</div>
<p>which describes the force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> exerted on a charged particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> with a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> in an electric field <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> and magnetic field <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>.  Due to the vector cross product, the force is always mutually perpendicular to both the direction of the velocity and magnetic field (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right-hand rule</a>).  Assuming that the electric field is negligible <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((E \ll vB\sin\theta)\)</span>, charged particles are forced to spiral around the magnetic field lines and cannot actually ross them except by collisions.  Closed magnetic field lines tend to trap charged particles, while open field lines allow the particles to travel away from the Sun.  Thus, <em>the solar wind originates from the coronal holes</em> (or regions of open magnetic field lines).  The bright regions in X-ray observations are due to the higher densities of charged particles (electrons and ions) that are trapped in large and small magnetic field loops.  A similar mechanism of trapping charged particles in magnetic fields occurs on the Earth through the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">auroras</a> (aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights)) and the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Van Allen radiation belts</a>.</p>

<p>The Ulysses spacecraft was placed on an inclined, heliocentric orbit and was still able to detect the solar wind.

<p>Since the corona is very hot and has a high thermal conductivity, it can referred to as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)">plasma</a>.  The ability of a plasma to conduct heat implies that the corona is almost isothermal.  In 1958, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Parker">Eugene Parker</a> developed an approximately isothermal model of the solar wind.</p>
<p>We begin by considering the corona to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, which means that the <em>outward</em> pressure is balanced by the <em>inward</em> pull of gravity.  If the mass of the corona is insignificant compared to the total mass of the Sun, then the mass enclosed at a given radius of the corona <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r\)</span> is approximately equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_\odot\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r \approx M_\odot\)</span>) and the equation for the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a> becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{G M_\odot \rho}{r^2}. \tag{4} \]</div>
<p>For simplicity, we assume that the gas is completely ionized hydrogen so that the number density of protons is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ n \approx \frac{\rho}{m_p}. \]</div>
<p>Then, from the ideal gas law we can write the pressure as</p>

<p>To develop a better understanding of the solar atmosphere’s structure, the approximation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be replaced by a set of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics">hydrodynamic equations</a> that describe the flow.

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>In the convection zone there is a motion of the hot gas rising and the return flow of the cool gas sinking, which sets up longitudinal (pressure) waves that propagate outward through the photosphere and into the chromosphere.  The outward <em>flux</em> of wave energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_E\)</span> is given by</p>

The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Speed_of_sound_in_ideal_gases_and_air">sound speed</a> is given by</p>

<p>A wave that begins at the top of the convection zone will have a wave oscillation amplitude less than the sound speed (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_w&lt;v_s\)</span>).

<p>A shock wave is characterized by a steep density change over a short distance, which is called the <strong>shock front</strong>.  A shock moving through a gas produces a great deal of heat via collision, which leaves the gas in its wake highly ionized.  The heating comes at the expense of mechanical energy of the shock and thus, the shock quickly dissipates.

The temperature structure of the outer solar atmosphere is expected to result from the presence of the magnetic field.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics">Magnetohydrodynamics</a> (or <strong>MHD</strong>) is the study of interactions between magnetic fields and plasmas.  A complete solution to the MHD equations applied to the Sun’s outer atmosphere does not yet exist.  but, there are some useful aspects to the partial solutions.</p>
<p>A second kind of wave motion can be generated by the presence of a magnetic field, which are transverse waves that propagate along a magnetic field line.  These waves are a consequence of the restoring force associated with the magnetic field lines.  Recall that a magnetic field requires energy (i.e., no magnetic monopole) through moving charges or currents and the energy can be described as begin stored within the magnetic field itself as a magnetic field energy density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u_m\)</span>.  The value of the magnetic energy density is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ u_m = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_o}, \tag{9} \]</div>
<p>which depends on the permeability of free space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_o = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\:{\rm Tm/A}\)</span>. Recall that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\:{\rm T} = 1 {\rm \frac{N}{A\cdot m}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The density of magnetic field lines increases if a plasma (containing a number of magnetic field lines) is compressed in a direction perpendicular to the lines.  But the density of lines is proportional the strength of the magnetic field itself and the energy density increases during the compression.  A change in volume (i.e., compression) of the plasma leads to work being done <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((W=\int P dV)\)</span> and this implies the existence of a magnetic pressure, which is equal to the magnetic energy density,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ u_m = P_m = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_o}. \tag{10}\]</div>
<p>The <em>magnetic pressure gradient</em> acts to compensate for an increase in the magnetic pressure in the direction of the magnetic field lines with an decrease in pressure in the opposite direction.  The pressure change restores the field line density to its original value.  This process is analogous to how the tension restores a string after it is plucked and a wave propagates along the string.  This transverse MHD wave is called an <strong>Alfvén wave</strong>.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n">Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén</a> (1908-1995) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1970 for his fundamental studies in MHD and thus, Alfvén waves are named after him.</p>
</div>
<p>The propagation speed of an Alfvén wave can be estimated using an analogy to the adiabatic sound speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_s\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma \approx 1\)</span> as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ v_m \sim \sqrt{\frac{P_m}{\rho}} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{2\mu_o \rho}}, \]</div>
<p>and a more careful treatment gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ v_m = \frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_o \rho}}. \tag{11} \]</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>How does the sound speed compare to the Alfvén speed in the solar photosphere?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The gas pressure at the top of the photosphere is roughly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(140\:{\rm N/m^2}\)</span> with a density of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.9\times 10^{-6}\:{\rm kg/m^3}\)</span>.  Assuming an ideal monatomic gas (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma = 5/3\)</span>), the sound speed is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ v_s = \sqrt{\frac{(5/3)(140\:{\rm N/m^2})}{4.9\times \times 10^{-6}\:{\rm kg/m^3}}} \simeq 7000 \:{\rm m/s}. \]</div>
<p>A typical surface magnetic field strength is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\times 10^{-4}\:{\rm T}\)</span>, then the magnetic pressure is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ P_m = \frac{(2\times 10^{-4}\:{\rm T})^2}{2(4\pi \times 10^{-7}\:{\rm T m/A})} \simeq 0.02\:{\rm N/m^2}. \]</div>
<p>Then the Alfvén speed is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ v_m = \frac{2\times 10^{-4}\:{\rm T}}{\sqrt{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}\:{\rm T m/A})(4.9\times \times 10^{-6}\:{\rm kg/m^3})}} = 81\:{\rm m/s}. \]</div>
<p>The magnetic pressure may generally be neglected in photospheric hydrostatic considerations because it is smaller than the gas pressure by roughly four orders of magnitude (i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{\rm photo}/P_m\)</span>).  However, much larger magnetic field strengths can exist in localized regions on the Sun’s surface.</p>

<p>Alfvén waves transport energy outwards, since they can propagate along magnetic field lines.  From Maxwell’s equations, a time-varying magnetic field induces electrical currents in a highly conductive plasma and thus, some resistive Joule heating will occur causing the temperature to rise.  MHD wave can also contribute to the temperature structure of the upper solar atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Sun’s rotation drags the open magnetic field lines along through interplanetary space.  The solar wind is forced to move with the field lines and a torque is produced that actually slows the Sun’s rotation.  The differential rotation present in the photosphere is not manifested in the corona, which is interesting because the magnetic field influences the structure of the corona but not through its rotation.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.1. </span>Sunspots<a class="headerlink" href="#sunspots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It was Galileo who made the first telescopic observations of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot">sunspots</a>.  Even though sunspots are occasionally visible with the naked eye, making such observations is <em>strongly discouraged</em> due to the potential for eye damage.  <a class="reference external" href="https://aty.sdsu.edu/vision/others.html">Newton</a> temporarily blinded himself by trying to look at the Sun using a mirror, though not to observe sunspots.  Reliable observations over the past 200 years show the number of sunspots and the average latitude of sunspot formation is approximately periodic with an 11-year cycle.  A plot of the sunspot location over time is known as the <strong>butterfly diagram</strong>.  Individual sunspots are short-lived (surviving no more than an month or so).  A sunspot remains at a constant latitude over its lifetime, while successive sunspots form at progressively lower latitudes.  New cycles of sunspots occur near <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 40^\circ\)</span> relative to the equator.</p>
<div align="center">

<p><strong>Figure 13</strong>: The upper figure depicts the butterfly diagram, showing sunspot latitudes with time. The lower figure shows the percentage of the Sun’s surface covered by sunspots as a function of time. (Carroll &amp; Ostlie (2007))</p>
</div>
<p>A key to understanding sunspots lies in their strong magnetic fields.  The darkest part of a sunspot is called the <strong>umbra</strong> and can be up to 30,000 km in diameter (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim2.5\times\)</span> Earth’s diameter).  The umbra is usually surrounded by the <strong>penumbra</strong>, whose appearance indicates the presence of magnetic field lines.  The magnetic fields can be measured through the Zeeman effect (i.e., splitting of spectral lines due to an external magnetic field), where such measurements indicate the strength and polarity of the magnetic field.  Magnetic field strengths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gtrsim 0.1\)</span> T have been measured in the centers of umbral regions and the field strength decreases across the penumbral regions.</p>

</div>
<p>Sunspots typically occur in groups, where a dominant sunspot leads in the direction of rotation and the remaining sunspots follow the leader.  During a cycle, the lead sunspot pair at symmetric latitudes (relative to the equator) will have opposite polarity, while the trailing sunspot pairs will have the opposite polarity.  During each successive 11-year sunspot cycle the polarities will be reversed.  Accompanying this local polarity reversal is a global polarity reversal of the Sun’s entire dipole.  Polarity reversals of the Sun occur on a 22-year cycle.</p>
<p>The dark appearance of the umbra is caused by their significantly lower temperatures (~3900 K) relative to the effective temperature (5777 K).  The luminosity difference is proportional to the temperature ratios raised to the fourth power, where a sunspot can be (5777/3900)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^4\)</span> = 4.8 times fainter than the surrounding photosphere.  Each sunspot has a lifetime of about a month and thus luminosity variations also occur on a timescale of months.  Although the Sun’s luminosity can experience a luminosity variation over a much longer timescale. For example, very few sunspots were observed from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1645-1715\)</span>, which corresponds to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum">Maunder minimum</a>.</p>
<p>With lower temperatures in sunspots, the gas pressure is also lower than the surrounding material and we would expect that gravity would cause the gas within a sunspot to sink.  But this is not observed, where the extra magnetic pressure supports the sunspot and keeps it from sinking.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plage_(astronomy)">Plages</a> (from the French word for <em>beach</em>) are chromospheric regions of bright <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H\alpha}\)</span> emission located near active sunspots.  They usually appear before the sunspots and disappear after the sunspots vanish.  Plages have higher densities that the surrounding gas and are products of magnetic fields .</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.2. </span>Solar Flares<a class="headerlink" href="#solar-flares" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare">Solar flares</a> are eruptive events that release between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{17}-10^{25}\)</span> J of energy over a range of time intervals (millisecond to more than an hour).  A large flare can reach 100,000 km in length.  During an eruption, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H \alpha}\)</span> line appears locally in emission rather than in absorption, implying that photon production occurs above much of the absorbing material.  Other types of EM radiation are produced that can range from <em>nonthermal</em> radio (~1 km) waves due to synchrotron radiation to hard (very short wavelength) X- and gamma-ray emission lines.</p>
<p>Charge particles are also ejected outward at high speeds becoming <strong>solar cosmic rays</strong> when they escape into interplanetary space.  The ejected charged particles (mostly protons and helium nuclei) can reach Earth in 30 min, disrupting communications and pose a threat to astronauts.  Shock waves can occasionally propagate several AU before dissipating.</p>
<p><strong>What powers a solar flare?</strong></p>
<p>The answer lies in the location of the flare eruption.  Flares develop in regions of great magnetic field intensity (e.g., sunspot groups).  The creation of magnetic fields results in energy storage in those magnetic fields.  A flare might develop when the stored energy is quickly released.  The details of the energy conversion are still a matter of active research.</p>
<p>A model of a solar flare shows the general mechanism involves <strong>reconnection</strong> of magnetic field lines.  A disturbance in the magnetic field loops causes the creation of sheet of current in the highly conducting plasma (via Lenz’s law).  The Joule heating from the resistance in the plasma causes temperatures to reach <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^7\)</span> K.  Particles accelerated away from a reconnection point (and away from the Sun) can escape the Sun entirely to become solar cosmic rays.  Radio, soft X-rays, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H\alpha}\)</span> emission can all occur as a result of the reconnection.</p>

<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence">solar prominence</a> is a large plasma and magnetic field structure that extends outwards from the Sun.  <strong>Quiescent prominences</strong> (or curtains of ionized gas) reach into the corona and can remain stable for weeks (or months).  An active region collects material along its magnetic field lines, which results in a cooler, denser gas compared to the surrounding corona.  This causes the gas to “rain” back down into the chromosphere.  An <strong>active</strong> (or eruptive) prominence may exist for only a few hours, where it disappears due to instabilities in the magnetic field lines that cause the prominence to lift away from the Sun.  This is similar to the production of flares, but the eruptive material is mainly gas ejected (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection">coronal mass ejection</a> or CMEs) from the Sun instead of EM radiation.</p>
<p>The solar corona can extend from a few solar radii up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30\:{\rm R_\odot}\)</span> and can average about one CME occurs per day over the 11-year sunspot cycle.  When the Sun is more active, this rate can increase to 3.5 CMEs per day.  At a solar minimum, the rate of CMEs decreases substantially to one event every five days.  During a CME event between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5\times 10^{12} - 5\times 10^{13}\)</span> kg of material may be ejected from the Sun traveling at speeds ranging from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(400-1000\)</span> km/s.  CMEs appear to be associated with prominences 70% of the time and flares 30% of the time.  CMEs are like magnetic bubbles that lift material of the Sun’s surface after a reconnection event and can carry a significant portion of the corona with it.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.4. </span>The Magnetic Dynamo Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#the-magnetic-dynamo-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory">magnetic dynamo</a> was first proposed by Horace Babcock in 1961, which describes many components of the solar cycle.  Despite its general success, the models doesn’t provide a complete picture.  Any complete picture will require:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>full treatment of the MHD equations in the solar environment,</p></li>
<li><p>differing rotation rates with latitude and depth of the Sun,</p></li>
<li><p>convection,</p></li>
<li><p>solar oscillations,</p></li>
<li><p>heating of the upper atmosphere,
and</p></li>
<li><p>mass loss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these processes are equally important, but a complete model should indicate the degree to which each process contributes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a cycle, the magnetic field lines are “frozen” into the gas, but the differential rotation of the Sun drags the lines along.  This converts a <em>poloidal</em> field (i.e., magnetic dipole) into a field with a <em>toroidal</em> component that wraps around the Sun.  The turbulent convection zone can twist the magnetic field lines and create <em>magnetic ropes</em> (i.e., regions of intense magnetic field due higher density of lines).  The magnetic pressure forces the ropes to rise to the surface as sunspot groups.  The polarity of the sunspots comes from the direction of magnetic field along the ropes.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/saturnaxis/ModernAstro/blob/main/Chapter_10/Figure_38.jpg?raw=true?" width="500">
<p><strong>Figure 16</strong>: The magnetic dynamo model of the solar cycle. (a) The solar magnetic field is initially a poloidal field. (b) Differential rotation drags the “frozen-in” magnetic field lines around the Sun. (c) Turbulent convection twists the field lines into magnetic ropes. (d) As the cycle progresses, successive sunspot groups migrate toward the equator where magnetic field reconnection reestablishes the poloidal field, but with the original polarity reversed. (Carroll &amp; Ostlie (2007))</p>
</div>
<p>The twisting begins at higher latitudes during a sunspot minimum, then differential rotation drags the field lines and convective ties them into knots, and more sunspots appear at intermediate latitudes leading to a sunspot maximum.  One might expect the greatest amount of twisting to occur at the equator, but sunspots near the equator tend to cancel each other out due to the polarity of the leading spots being opposed.  The cancellation of magnetic fields near the equator causes the poloidal field to be re-established, but with a reversal of polarity.</p>
