<p>The development of optics greatly enhanced our window into the universe starting with Galileo’s innovative use of the telescope.  Today we “see” with many different sets of eyes to get a fuller picture of the cosmos, discover faint objects otherwise unseen, and resolve distant objects in greater detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="refraction-and-reflection">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.1. </span>Refraction and Reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#refraction-and-reflection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first “telescope” was developed by Hans Lippershey in 1608 and a year later <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> built his own version with about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\times\)</span> magnification and later improved upon the design to obtain a version with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30\times\)</span> magnification.  These <strong>refracting</strong> telescopes consisted of lenses through which the light would pass and form an image.  In 1671, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> showed that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colors and he developed the <strong>reflecting</strong> telescope that used a mirror instead of a lens to bypass the problem.</p>
<p>Both types of telescopes use a lens to produce an image, which makes a natural starting point.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law">Snell’s law of refraction</a> describes how the path of a light ray changes as it travels through a lens. When a wave travels across a boundary between two media, its path is bent (<em>refracts</em>) at the interface.  The amount that the ray bends is material dependent and characterized by a wavelength-dependent index of refraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_\lambda = c/v_\lambda\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\lambda\)</span> represents the speed of light within the medium.  Alternatively, the index of refraction indicates how much the speed of light decreases within the medium (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\lambda = c/n_\lambda\)</span>) compared to vacuum.  Note that the frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> of the wave remains unchanged and the refracted wavelength must change.</p>
<p>The incoming ray possesses an angle of incidence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_i\)</span> and the refracted ray is bent by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_r\)</span>, where both angles are measured relative to the normal to the interface.  Then Snell’s law is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
n_1 \sin \theta_i = n_2 \sin \theta_r. \tag{1}
\]</div>

<p>Lens are shaped from glass so that the light rays can converge or diverge due to Snell’s law.  The light rays are traced where the lens is set perpendicular to the horizontal (or <strong>optical axis</strong>) to produce an axis of symmetry.  <em>Converging</em> lenses force the light rays to come to a point on the optical axis (opposite from the incoming rays).  This unique point is called the <strong>focal point</strong> of the lens and the distance to that point from the center of the lens is called the <strong>focal length</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>.  By changing the curvature of the lens, the light rays can instead diverge from the optical axis to make a <em>diverging</em> lens.  As a result, the focal point lies on the <em>same</em> side as the incoming rays.  For a converging lens , the focal length is defined as positive, where the focal length is negative for a diverging lens.</p>
<p>The focal length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_\lambda\)</span> of a thin lens can be calculated from the index of refraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_\lambda\)</span> and the radii of curvature of each surface (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_2\)</span>) assuming the surfaces are spheroidal.  The sign convention for the radii is positive (convex) and negative (concave).  The focal length is given by the <strong>lensmaker’s formula</strong>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ 
f_\lambda = \frac{1}{n_\lambda - 1}\left( \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\right). \tag {2}
\]</div>
<p>For mirrors, the focal length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is wavelength-independent since the light rays do not penetrate the surface and angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_i = \theta_r\)</span>).  A spheroidal mirror has a focal length at half the radius of curvature (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=R/2\)</span>) and can be positive/negative depending on the geometry.  Converging mirrors are generally used as the primary mirror in modern telescopes, although diverging or flat mirrors may be used for more complicated optical systems.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.3. </span>Resolution and the Rayleigh Criterion<a class="headerlink" href="#resolution-and-the-rayleigh-criterion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To resolve two closely spaced objects, its not simply a matter of choosing a sufficiently long focal length.  There is a fundamental limit to our ability to <em>resolve</em> the objects due to the diffraction produced by the advancing wavefronts from each object.  This phenomenon is related to the single slit diffraction pattern produced by a slit of width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span>.  Any ray passing through the opening (or <strong>aperture</strong>) and arriving at a specific point can be though of as being associated with another ray passing through the aperture a distance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D/2\)</span> away and arriving at the same point.  If the two rays are a half-wavelength (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda/2\)</span>) out of phase, then destructive interference will occur.  This leads to the relation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
D \sin \theta = m \lambda, \tag{4}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m = 1,2,3,\ldots\)</span> for dark fringes.  If a circular aperture is used (i.e., a telescope) the symmetry produces a series of concentric rings instead of the iconic diffraction pattern.  The mathematics of this pattern was solved by George Airy in 1835 and is known as the <strong>Airy disk</strong>.  If we relax Eqn 4 so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> is no longer an integer, then it can be used to find the maxima as well.</p>
<p>Two sources that are sufficiently close together will have diffraction rings that overlap and it becomes impossible to resolve.  The two images are said to unresolved when the central maximum of one pattern falls inside the location of the first minimum of the other, where this condition is the <strong>Rayleigh criterion</strong>.  Assuming that angular separation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_{\rm min}\)</span> is quite small and invoking the small-angle approximation, the Rayleigh criterion is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\theta_{\rm min} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \tag{5}

<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.4. </span>Aberrations<a class="headerlink" href="#aberrations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Image distortions or aberrations affect both lens and mirror systems.  Refracting telescopes suffer from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration">chromatic aberration</a>, which is a distortion due to the wavelength-dependent focus of a lens.  The lensmaker’s formula (Eqn 2) depends on the radii of curvature and the index of refraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>, but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> also depends on the wavelength <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>.  This translates into a wavelength-dependent focal length, where the focal point for red light is different than for blue light.</p>
<p>There can be aberrations that result from the shape of the reflecting or refracting surface.  Imperfections in the grinding/polishing of lens/mirrors mean not all areas will focus a parallel set of light rays to a single point.  This type of distortion is called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration">spherical aberration</a> and can be overcome with a corrective lens.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST) initially had imaging problems due to spherical aberration when a mistake was made while grinding the primary and left the center of the mirror too shallow by about 2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>.  A repair mission in 1993, installed a special corrective optics package on the telescope.</p>
<p>A <strong>coma</strong> produces elongated images of a point sources that lie off the optical axis. An <strong>astigmatism</strong> is a defect where different parts of a lens or mirror converge an image a slightly different locations on the focal plane.  Correcting for astigmatism can create other problems, such as the <strong>curvature of field</strong> that is due to the focusing of images on a curve rather than on a flat surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brightness-of-an-image">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.5. </span>Brightness of an Image<a class="headerlink" href="#brightness-of-an-image" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It might be assumed that the brightness of an extended (resolved) image depends on the area of the aperture.  This is the case for photography, where the camera has an adjustable aperture (iris) that controls how much light enters the camera to reach the detector on the focal plane.  For most astronomical applications, the aperture is fully open because the object is effectively infinitely far away (i.e., distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r \gg \)</span> focal length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>).  Then, it can be shown that the <strong>intensity</strong> of the radiation is the same for both the object and image; independent of the area of the aperture.  The exception is for bright objects (e.g., the Moon), where an adjustable iris helps prevent over-exposing the image (i.e., saturation).</p>
<p>The light-gathering power of telescopes is the <strong>illumination</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J\)</span> or the number of photons per second that are focused onto a unit area of a resolved image.  When comparing telescopes, the amount of light collected is proportional to the area of the aperture or the illumination <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J \propto \pi D^2/4\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is the diameter of the telescope’s aperture.  Through the plate scale (Eqn 3) we have the linear size of the image proportional to the focal length of the lens and the image area is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^2\)</span>.  The illumination is proportional to the ratio of the aperture diameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> to the focal length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J\propto D^2/f^2\)</span>).  The inverse of the ratio is ofter referred to as the <strong>focal ratio</strong> (or f-ratio),</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ F = \frac{f}{D}. \tag{6} \]</div>
<p>The illumination indicates the amount of time required to collect the photons needed to form a bright image.  A larger focal ratio corresponds to a slower telescope, which means that a longer exposure is necessary to reach an equivalent illumination.</p>

<p>where a review is available on <a class="reference external" href="https://openstax.org/books/college-physics/pages/26-5-telescopes">openstax.org/books/college-physics</a>.  Since the objective lens tends to be a fixed part of the telescope, several eyepieces (of different focal lengths) can be used to produce different angular magnifications.  Note that viewing a large image requires a long objective in combination with a short focal length for the eyepiece.</p>
<p>Recall that the illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the objective’s focal length and a larger diameter objective is needed to compensate.  However, there are practical limitations for to the size of a refracting telescope’s objective.  The lens is supported only around its edges and the shape of the lens deforms due to gravity when the size and weight are increased.  Furthermore, the type of deformation changes as the orientation of the telescope varies.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the construction of the lens, which can have defects.  The light must pass through the <em>entire volume</em> of the lens and the quality must be nearly optically perfect.  Defects in the desired shape of the lens must be kept to a small fraction (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda/20\)</span>) of the wavelength (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda = 400-700\)</span> nm for visible light).  A large objective lens also has a slow thermal response, where the telescope must adjust to the temperature of the outside air after the dome is opened.  Thermally driven air currents develop around the telescope, which compound the normal concerns around “seeing”.  The overall shape of the telescope will change as a consequence of thermal expansion, which alters the optical alignment.</p>
<p>Considering all of these challenges (along with the unique problem of chromatic aberration), the vast majority of all large modern telescopes are reflectors.  The largest refracting telescope in use today is at the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory">Yerkes Observatory</a> in Williams Bay, Wisconsin.  It has a 40-in (1.02 m) objective with a focal length of 19.36 m.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2. </span>Reflecting Telescopes<a class="headerlink" href="#reflecting-telescopes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A reflecting telescope is designed by replacing the objective lens with a mirror, which either reduces or eliminates many of the problems with refracting telescopes.  The light does not pass through a mirror and thus, much less precision is required in its construction (i.e., only one surface needs to be ground with precision).  The weight of the mirror can be minimized by using a lighter honeycomb structure behind the reflecting surface.  As a result, parts of the mirror can be mechanically deformed to correct for thermal and/or gravitational effects as the telescope moves (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics">adaptive optics</a>).</p>
<p>Although there are many benefits in using a mirror, there are some costs.  The primary mirror reflects the light back along the optical axis (i.e., law of reflection) to the focal point (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope#Prime_focus">prime focus</a>).  A detector can be placed at this location, but some of the incident light is blocked.  Additionally, the structure supporting the detector introduces diffraction spikes in the image of the stars.  Isaac Newton found a solution to the problem of the prime focus by placing a small, flat mirror in the reflected light’s path changing the location of the focal point.  A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope">Newtonian telescope</a> design suffers a mechanical cost because the eyepiece (or detector) must be placed a significant distance from the telescope’s center of mass and would exert a significant torque on the telescope.</p>
<p>The secondary mirror effectively produces a shadow on the primary mirror (rendering a small area useless) and a hole can be bored into the primary mirror so that the reflected light comes through the hole.  This <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassegrain_reflector">Cassegrain</a> design makes it possible to place a massive detector near the telescope’s center of mass and the observer can stay near the bottom of the telescope.  The secondary mirror is usually convex, while the primary mirror is concave .  However, a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchey%E2%80%93Chr%C3%A9tien_telescope">Ritchey-Chrétien</a> has a hyperbolic primary mirror rather than a parabolic one.  The Ritchey-Chrétien design has a wider field of view and eliminates off-axis optical errors (coma).  Some well-known examples are the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck telescopes and the ESO Very Large Telescope.</p>
<p>If the instrument package is too massive, astronomers use a series of mirrors to reflect the light down the telescope’s mount to a <em>coudé room</em> located below the telescope (i.e., <strong>coudé telescope</strong>).  Because of the extended optical path, a very long focal length is needed and is particularly useful in spectral line studies.  A modification of the Cassegrain design uses a spheroidal primary mirror (to minimize coma) combined with a “correcting” lens to help remove spherical aberration.  The benefit of a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt%E2%80%93Cassegrain_telescope">Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope</a> is a wider field of view and is important for survey studies of large regions of sky.</p>

CCDs are able to detect nearly 100% of the incident photons over a very wide range of wavelengths.  CCDs also have a wide dynamic range, where they can differentiate between very bright and dim objects viewed simultaneously.</p>
<p>A CCD works by collecting electrons that are excited into higher energy states (conduction bands) when a detector is struck by a photon.  The number of electrons collected in each pixel is proportional to the image brightness.  HST’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC 2) has 2.5 million pixels with each pixel capable of holding up to 70,000 electrons.

<p>By the 1930s, radio was the state-of-the-art in terms of communications for the United States and Europe.  Companies, such as Bell Labs, were interested in short wave (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda = 10-20\)</span> m) transmissions for use in a trans-Atlantic radio service, where properties of the atmosphere and ionosphere could introduce static to radio voice transmissions.  In 1928, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Guthe_Jansky">Karl Jansky</a> was assigned the task of investigating the sources of static and by 1931, he discovered that some of the static in his receiver was of “extraterrestrial origin.”  Jansky concluded (correctly) that much of the measured signal originated from the plane of the Milky Way.  Jansky’s work pioneered the birth of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy"><em>radio astronomy</em></a> as a new way to view and investigate the cosmos.</p>
<p>Radio telescopes operate differently from their optical counterparts, where radio observations can be taken any time of day or night.  But, observations from the Earth’s surface are limited to a specific range of wavelengths (i.e., those that can pass through the atmosphere). At long wavelengths, transmission is limited by the ionosphere.  Water vapor interferes with radio astronomy at shorter wavelengths, which has led to building radio observatories that conduct observations at millimeter wavelengths at very high and dry sites (e.g., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array">ALMA</a>), to minimize the water vapor content in the line of sight.  These are some of the known sources of noise to avoid and the increasing needs of human telecommunication force astronomers to build observatories in remote areas.</p>

<p>For comparison, the dish at <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory">Arecibo Observatory</a> is 305 m across and was the largest single aperture radio telescope before the construction of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope">FAST</a>) in southwest China.  The aperture would need to be about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(200\times\)</span> larger to observe down to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.5^{\prime\prime}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The solution to improved resolution is accomplished through a technique called interferometry, which uses multiple telescopes to mimic a larger aperture.  As a result, astronomers have nevertheless been able to resolve radio images to better than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.001^{\prime\prime}\)</span>.  For interferometry to work, astronomers utilize two radio telescopes (of modest size) separated by a baseline distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>.  This is similar to the Young double-slit experiment, where the baseline is analogous to the slit spacing.  For the  signal to arrive at both telescopes <em>in-phase</em> and at a maximum intensity, the extra distance traveled to one telescope must be an integral number of wavelengths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L = n\lambda\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = 0,1,2,\ldots\)</span>.  Alternatively, the signal will destructively interfere if the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L = (n-1/2)\lambda\)</span> is a odd number of half-wavelengths.  The pointing angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is then determined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{L}{d}, \tag{9} \]</div>
<p>if the signals of the two antennas are combined and a source can be accurately located.  The image resolution can be increased if two signals are received and reconstructed such that the resulting signal is coherent.  Clearly, Equation 9 shows this is most easily done with a longer baseline <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry">Very long baseline interferometry</a> (VLBI) is possible using instruments across a whole continent or even between continents. for example, the Event Horizon Telescope (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope">EHT</a>) combined contemporaneous observations of M87’s galactic center to produce a direct image of a black hole’s accretion disk.  It used data from radio telescopes across the world, where the exact time of data acquisition was recorded and reconstructed the image.</p>
<p>A single antenna has its greatest sensitivity along its pointed direction, but it can also be sensitive to radio sources at other angles.  A typical antenna <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pattern">pattern</a> maximizes the symmetry in dipole radiation, where there are three regions: a main lobe, back lobe and sidelobes.  The <em>longer</em> the lobe, the more sensitive the telescope is in that direction.  Note that the directionality of the beam is not perfect and components of the sidelobes contributed to a background noise.  The narrowness of the main lobe is referred to as the <strong>half-power beam width</strong> (HPBW) or angular width at half its length.  This width can be modulated by the addition of other telescopes to produce a particular diffraction pattern (i.e., similar to the increase in grating lines for optical diffraction) and the effect of the sidelobes can be reduced.</p>

COBE was followed by two more advanced spacecraft: the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) operated from 2001 to 2010 and the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck spacecraft</a> from 2009 to 2013</p>
<p>Shorter wavelengths require a very precise reflecting surface and it wasn’t until the Space Age could UV, X-ray, or Gamma-ray observations could be performed.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ultraviolet_Explorer">International Ultraviolet Explorer</a> (IUE) was operated from 1978-1996 and proved to be a remarkably productive instrument.  The most famous X-ray telescope <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory">Chandra</a> has been in operation from 1999 and operates from 6.2 - 0.1 nm (0.2 - 10 keV) with an angular resolution of approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.5^{\prime\prime}\)</span>.  Because X-rays cannot be focused in the same way that longer wavelengths can, grazing incidence mirrors are used to achieve the outstanding resolving power of Chandra.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory">Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a> (CGRO) was a space observatory designed to detect radiation with energy from 20 keV to 30 GeV.  The observatory was in operation from Earth orbit from 1991-2000 and housed four main telescopes that completed the first all sky survey for energies above 100 MeV.  Successors to CGRO include the ESA <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTEGRAL">INTEGRAL spacecraft</a> (launched 2002), NASA’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gehrels_Swift_Observatory">Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission</a> (launched 2004), ASI <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGILE_(satellite)">AGILE</a> (launched 2007) and NASA’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> (launched 2008); all remain operational as of 2019.</p>
