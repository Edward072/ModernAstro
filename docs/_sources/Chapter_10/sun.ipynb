    "Our Sun is classified as a typical main-sequence star of spectral class G2, which contains mostly hydrogen $(X=0.74)$, some helium $(Y=0.24)$, and a little metal ($Z=0.02)$ by mass.  The composition has changed (evolved) over time because it has been converting hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain for most of its lifetime.  Even though the Sun is changing over time, we can still estimate its age using other bodies of the Solar System.  For example, radioactive dating of Moon rocks and meteorites indicate that they are ~4.57 Gyr old and the Sun would be *at least* as old as these rocks.  Since becoming a main-sequence star, the Sun's luminosity has increased by nearly 48% and its radius has increased by 15%, which lead to an increase a 2.7% increase in its effective temperature.  The effect of this luminosity increase on the Earth is unclear due to the Earth's time-varying ability to reflect light through its albedo (caused by surface water and ice).\n",

    "For decades, there was an inconsistency between the observations of the Sun and the model, where the solution resulting in an important new understanding of fundamental physics.  In 1970, Raymond  Davis began measuring the neutrino flux from the Sun.  His detector was located almost 1 mile below ground within a gold mine in Lead, South Dakota.  The neutrino has a very low cross section for interaction with other matter, which makes it difficult to detect.  *Like the eye of Sauron*, neutrinos penetrate where other particles cannot.  The detector was placed underground to lower the background noise and ensure that it was only measuring neutrinos.\n",

    "The neutrino detector contained ~100,000 gallons of cleaning fluid, ${\\rm C_2Cl_4}$ (tetrachloroethylene), because chlorine interacts with ${\\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}$ to produce ${\\rm ^{37}_{18}Ar}$ that has a half-life of 35 days,\n",

    "Unfortunately, this reaction is very rare (1:5000).  Every few months, Davis and his collaborators purged the accumulated argon and determined the number of argon atoms produced.  The capture rate was measured using the **solar neutrino unit**, where 1 SNU equals $10^{-36}$ reactions per target atom per second.  The tank contained $\\sim10^{30}$ ${\\rm ^{37}_{17}Cl}$ atoms, which corresponds to 5.35 SNU if only 1 argon atom was produced each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Bahcall computed the anticipated capture rate of 7.9 SNU, while the actual data (taken between 1970 and 1994) yielded an average of $2.56 \\pm 0.16$ SNU.  About one-third of the expected yield.  Other experiments have confirmed the discrepancy including Japan's underground Super-Kamiokande observatory.  This observatory detects the **Cerenkov light** produced when neutrinos scatter electrons.  Through this measurement only half of the neutrinos are detected compared to the predictions from solar models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deficit of neutrinos suggested that either **(a)** some fundamental physical process in the solar model is incorrect or **(b)** something happens to the neutrinos in-transit (i.e., on their way from the Sun's core to the Earth).  The **Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein** (or MSW) effect involves transformation of neutrinos between the three types ($\\nu_\\mu$, $\\nu_\\tau$, and $\\nu_e$).  This idea is an extension of the *electroweak theory** fof particle physics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmation of this idea came in 1998 when Super-Kamiokande was used to detect *atmospheric neutrinos* produced in Earth's upper atmosphere.  Cosmic rays are capable of producing only electron and muon neutrinos.  Super-Kamiokande determined that the number of $\\nu_\\mu$ traveling upward was significantly reduced compared to those traveling downward, where the difference in numbers is in excellent agreement with the theory of neutrino mixing.  For neutrino mixing to occur, the neutrino could not be a massless particle and the experiment confirmed this as well.  After several decades the solar neutrino problem was resolved by a profound advance in our understanding of particle physics."

The corona is a source of radio emission, where some of this emission arises from *free-free* transitions as electrons pass near ions.  Due to these encounters, the change in energy of the electron determines the wavelength of the resulting photon through conservation of energy.

    "### Sunspots\n",
    "It was Galileo who made the first telescopic observations of [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot).  Even though sunspots are occasionally visible with the naked eye, making such observations is *strongly discouraged* due to the potential for eye damage.  [Newton](https://aty.sdsu.edu/vision/others.html) temporarily blinded himself by trying to look at the Sun using a mirror, though not to observe sunspots.  Reliable observations over the past 200 years show the number of sunspots and the average latitude of sunspot formation is approximately periodic with an 11-year cycle.  A plot of the sunspot location over time is known as the **butterfly diagram**.  Individual sunspots are short-lived (surviving no more than an month or so).  A sunspot remains at a constant latitude over its lifetime, while successive sunspots form at progressively lower latitudes.  New cycles of sunspots occur near $\\pm 40^\\circ$ relative to the equator.\n",

    "\n",
    "A key to understanding sunspots lies in their strong magnetic fields.  The darkest part of a sunspot is called the **umbra** and can be up to 30,000 km in diameter ($\\sim2.5\\times$ Earth's diameter).  The umbra is usually surrounded by the **penumbra**, whose appearance indicates the presence of magnetic field lines.  The magnetic fields can be measured through the Zeeman effect (i.e., splitting of spectral lines due to an external magnetic field), where such measurements indicate the strength and polarity of the magnetic field.  Magnetic field strengths $\\gtrsim 0.1$ T have been measured in the centers of umbral regions and the field strength decreases across the penumbral regions. \n",

    "\n",
    "Sunspots typically occur in groups, where a dominant sunspot leads in the direction of rotation and the remaining sunspots follow the leader.  During a cycle, the lead sunspot pair at symmetric latitudes (relative to the equator) will have opposite polarity, while the trailing sunspot pairs will have the opposite polarity.  During each successive 11-year sunspot cycle the polarities will be reversed.  Accompanying this local polarity reversal is a global polarity reversal of the Sun's entire dipole.  Polarity reversals of the Sun occur on a 22-year cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dark appearance of the umbra is caused by their significantly lower temperatures (~3900 K) relative to the effective temperature (5777 K).  The luminosity difference is proportional to the temperature ratios raised to the fourth power, where a sunspot can be (5777/3900)$^4$ = 4.8 times fainter than the surrounding photosphere.  Each sunspot has a lifetime of about a month and thus luminosity variations also occur on a timescale of months.  Although the Sun's luminosity can experience a luminosity variation over a much longer timescale. For example, very few sunspots were observed from $1645-1715$, which corresponds to the [Maunder minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum).\n",
    "\n",
    "With lower temperatures in sunspots, the gas pressure is also lower than the surrounding material and we would expect that gravity would cause the gas within a sunspot to sink.  But this is not observed, where the extra magnetic pressure supports the sunspot and keeps it from sinking."

    "### Solar Flares\n",
    "[Solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) are eruptive events that release between $10^{17}-10^{25}$ J of energy over a range of time intervals (millisecond to more than an hour).  A large flare can reach 100,000 km in length.  During an eruption, the ${\\rm H \\alpha}$ line appears locally in emission rather than in absorption, implying that photon production occurs above much of the absorbing material.  Other types of EM radiation are produced that can range from *nonthermal* radio (~1 km) waves due to synchrotron radiation to hard (very short wavelength) X- and gamma-ray emission lines.\n",

    "Charge particles are also ejected outward at high speeds becoming **solar cosmic rays** when they escape into interplanetary space.  The ejected charged particles (mostly protons and helium nuclei) can reach Earth in 30 min, disrupting communications and pose a threat to astronauts.  Shock waves can occasionally propagate several AU before dissipating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What powers a solar flare?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in the location of the flare eruption.  Flares develop in regions of great magnetic field intensity (e.g., sunspot groups).  The creation of magnetic fields results in energy storage in those magnetic fields.  A flare might develop when the stored energy is quickly released.  The details of the the energy conversion are still a matter of active research.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model of a solar flare shows the general mechanism involves **reconnection** of magnetic field lines.  A disturbance in the magnetic field loops causes the creation of sheet of current in the highly conducting plasma (via Lenz's law).  The Joule heating from the resistance in the plasma causes temperatures to reach $10^7$ K.  Particles accelerated away from a reconnection point (and away from the Sun) can escape the Sun entirely to become solar cosmic rays.  Radio, soft X-rays, and ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ emission can all occur as a result of the reconnection.\n",

    "### Solar Prominences & Coronal Mass Ejections\n",
    "A [solar prominence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence) is a large plasma and magnetic field structure that extends outwards from the Sun.  **Quiescent prominences** (or curtains of ionized gas) reach into the corona and can remain stable for weeks (or months).  An active region collects material along its magnetic field lines, which results in a cooler, denser gas compared to the surrounding corona.  This causes the gas to \"rain\" back down into the chromosphere.  An **active** (or eruptive) prominence may exist for only a few hours, where it disappears due to instabilities in the magnetic field lines that cause the prominence to lift away from the Sun.  This is similar to the production of flares, but the eruptive material is mainly gas ejected (i.e., [coronal mass ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) or CMEs) from the Sun instead of EM radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solar corona can extend from a few solar radii up to $30\\:{\\rm R_\\odot}$ and can average about one CME occurs per day over the 11-year sunspot cycle.  When the Sun is more active, this rate can increase to 3.5 CMEs per day.  At a solar minimum, the rate of CMEs decreases substantially to one event every five days.  During a CME event between $5\\times 10^{12} - 5\\times 10^{13}$ kg of material may be ejected from the Sun traveling at speeds ranging from $400-1000$ km/s.  CMEs appear to be associated with prominences 70% of the time and flares 30% of the time.  CMEs are like magnetic bubbles that lift material of the Sun's surface after a reconnection event and can carry a significant portion of the corona with it."

The turbulent convection zone can twist the magnetic field lines and create *magnetic ropes* (i.e., regions of intense magnetic field due higher density of lines).
