Much of the theoretical foundation was understood in the first half of the 20th Century, it wasn't until the 1960s that computers were advanced enough to carry out all the calculations.  Although computer modeling and evolutions is a success, there are numerous questions that remain unanswered.\n",

    "The theoretical study of stellar structure shows that stars are dynamic objects that typically change over very slow timescales (compared to us mortals), but some events can be very rapid and dramatic.  Consider the observed energy output of the Sun, which is $3.839 \\times 10^{26}$ J of energy emitted per second.  This energy output would be sufficient to melt a column of ice with a square mile area and 1 AU thick in only 0.3 seconds (assuming 100% absorption efficiency).  Stars have a finite supply of energy, where they must eventually use up their fuel and die.  *Stellar evolution is the result of a constant fight against the relentless pull of gravity.*"

    "In stellar interiors, energy is transported through **radiation**, **convection**, and **conduction**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Radiation allows the energy produced by nuclear reactions and gravitation to be carried to the surface via *photons*.  The photons are absorbed and re-emitted in nearly random directions as the encounter matter, where the opacity must play an important role.\n",
    "- Convection can be more efficient in some parts of the star with hot, buoyant mass elements carrying excess energy outward while cool elements fall inward (i.e., an energy escalator).\n",
    "- Conduction transports heat via collisions between particles, which is the least efficient method for stellar environments.  As a result, it is generally insignificant throughout a majority of the stellar lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Radiative Temperature Gradient\n",
    "For radiation transport, we need a description of how the radiation varies with the distance from the center $r$.  The radiation pressure gradient is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = -\\frac{\\overline{\\kappa}\\rho}{c}F_{rad}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and depends on the outward radiative flux $F_{rad}$.  From Eqn. 19 (see [Sect. 7.2.4](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_11/interiors-of-stars.html#the-contribution-due-to-radiation-pressure)), the radiation pressure gradient may be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = \\frac{4}{3}aT^3 \\frac{dT}{dr}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which depends on the radiation constant $a=4\\sigma/c$.  Solving for $dT/dr$ in terms of $F_{rad}$, produces\n",

    "and the temperature gradient for radiative transport becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{3}{4ac}\\frac{\\overline{\\kappa}\\rho}{T^3}\\frac{L_r}{4\\pi r^2}. \\tag{36}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As either flux or opacity increases, the temperature gradient becomes *steeper* (more negative), which *opposes* the transport of the required luminosity outward.  The same situations holds as the density increases or temperature decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pressure Scale Height\n",
    "Once the temperature gradient becomes too steep, convection becomes the more efficient method in the transport of energy.  Convection involves mass motions: *hot parcels of matter move upward as cooler, denser parcels sink*.  Unfortunately, convection is more complex than radiation at the macroscopic level.  *Fluid mechanics* is a field of physics that describes the motion of gases and liquids through the 3D [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations).  Solving these equations is very difficult, even for computers, and it becomes necessary to approximate the solution through a 1D model.  Additionally, the equations are non-linear, which can lead to turbulent (and chaotic) flows rather than laminar flows.  Turbulence is characterized by the amount of *viscosity* (fluid friction) and heat dissipation.  The timescale for convection is in some cases approximately equal to timescales for structural changes in the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "A characteristic length scale for convection is the **pressure scale height** $H_p$, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{H_p} \\equiv - \\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dr}. \\tag{37} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that $H_p$ is a constant, then we can solve (by separation of variables) for the pressure with radius as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = P_o e^{-r/H_p}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $r = H_p$, then $P= P_o/e$ and thus, $H_p$ is the distance over which the gas pressure decreases by a factor of $e$.  From [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_11/interiors-of-stars.html#the-derivation-of-the-hydrostatic-equilibrium-equation), we can write the pressure gradient in terms of the local acceleration of gravity $g = G M_r/r^2$.  By substitution, the pressure scale height is\n",
