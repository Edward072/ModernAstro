    "### Determining the Internal Structures of Stars\n",
    "Astronomers must generate computer models to deduce the detailed internal structure of stars, where these models mus be consistent with the known physical laws and agree with observable surface features.  Much of the theoretical foundation was understood in the first half of the 20th Century, it wasn't until the 1960s that computers were advanced enough to carry out all the calculations.  Although computer modeling and evolutions is a success, there are numerous questions that remain unanswered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical study of stellar structure shows that stars are dynamic objects that typically change over very slow timescales (compared to us mortals), but some events can be very rapid and dramatic.  Consider the observed energy output of the Sun, which is $3.839 \\times 10^{26}$ J of energy emitted per second.  This energy output would be sufficient to melt a column of ice with a square mile area and 1 AU thick in only 0.3 seconds (assuming 100% absorption efficiency).  Stars have a finite supply of energy, where they must eventually use up their fuel and die.  *Stellar evolution is the result of a constant fight against the relentless pull of gravity.*"

    "The gravitational force is always attractive (as opposed to the electrostatic force that has opposite charges).  Therefore, an opposing force (e.g., supplied by pressure) must exist in a star to avoid collapse.  Just like the ocean, the pressure within a star varies with depth.  \n",

    "2. Assume that the only forces acting on the cylinder are *gravity* and the *force due to pressure*, which is always normal (radially) to the top and bottom cylinder surface.  \n",

The pressure forces on the *curved* side of the cylinder will cancel due to symmetry and have been explicitly excluded from the expression.\n",
