    "### The Interstellar Medium\n",
    "The evolution of stars is a cyclic process, where a star is born out of gas and dust that exists between the stars (i.e., **interstellar medium** or ISM).  During a star's lifetime, much of that material may return to the ISM through stellar winds or explosive events.  The next generation of stars can then form from the ashes, which are processed by the nuclear fusion within the deep interiors of stars.  Thus it's important to study the nature of the ISM so that we can better understand stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISM is an enormous and complex environment that provides a laboratory for testing our basic understanding of astrophysics (i.e., its the testbed to develop sensible initial conditions for stellar models).  The ISM interacts with the stellar environment through shocks and galactic magnetic fields that extend into interstellar space.  As a result, modeling the ISM requires detailed modeling of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations."

    "### Interstellar Extinction\n",

These dark regions are not devoid of stars, but the intervening dust blocks the background starlight.  Dust that blocks starlight is due to the combined effet of scattering and absorption, which is called **interstellar extinction**.

There are *unidentified IR emission bands* between $3.3-12\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$ and appear to arise from vibrations in the C-C and C-H bonds common in PAHs.  The energies associated with molecular bonds are quantized like atomic energy levels.  However, the energy levels tend to group in closely space bands, which produces the characteristic broad features in the continuum.  The vibration, rotation, and bending of molecular bonds are all quantized, which yields complex spectra that may be difficult to identify in large molecules.\n",

    "### The Heating and Cooling of the ISM\n",
    "Molecules and dust grains play important roles in the *heating* and *cooling* of the ISM.  Diffuse molecular clouds have higher gas temperatures than GMCs and the dense cores of GMCs are even cooler yet.  The hot cores of GMCs have significantly greater temperatures.  *What are the physical causes of these observational trends?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the heating of the ISM comes from **cosmic rays**, or charged particles that travel through space with astonishing amounts of energy.  A single proton can have a kinetic energy ranging from $10^1-10^{14}\\,{\\rm MeV}$.  The highest energy cosmic rays are extremely rare, but energies from$10^3-10^8\\,{\\rm MeV}$ are common.  The sources of cosmic rays include stellar flares and supernova explosions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heating by cosmic rays comes (primarily) through the ionization of hydrogen atoms and molecules as a result of collisions with cosmic ray protons:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*}\n",
    "p^+ + {\\rm H} &\\rightarrow {\\rm H^+} + e^- + p^+ \\\\\n",
    "p^+ + {\\rm H_2} &\\rightarrow {\\rm H_2^+} + e^- + p^+. \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When an atom or molecule is ionized, the ejected electron carries some of the original kinetic energy with it.  The ejected electron, interacts with the ISM to increase the average kinetic energy of the ISM via collisions with molecules.  Those molecules then collide with other molecules, thereby distributing the thermal kinetic energy throughout the cloud and raising the temperature of the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sources of heating include the ionization of carbon atoms by UV photons, the photoelectric ejection of electrons from dust grains via UV, the absorption of light energy into the lattice of dust grains, and the ionization of hydrogen by stellar X-rays.  Shocks from supernovae or strong stellar winds can also produce some heating of molecular clouds in special cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To balance the heating processes, cooling mechanisms must also be in operation.  The primary mechanism for cooling is through the emission of IR photons because the IR photons can escape the molecular cloud more easily (i.e., Mie scattering) than shorter wavelength photons.  IR photons are produced in molecular clouds through collisions between ions, atoms, molecules, and dust grains.  Typically a collision results in excitation, where the energy of the excited state decays back to the ground state through the emission of an IR photon.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*}\n",
    "{\\rm O} + {\\rm H} &\\rightarrow {\\rm O^*} + {\\rm H} \\\\\n",
    "{\\rm O^*} &\\rightarrow {\\rm O} + \\gamma.\n",
    "\\end{align*} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The superscript $*$ represents an excited state of an atom.  The collisional kinetic energy (i.e., thermal energy) is thus transformed into an IR photon that escapes the cloud.  Collisional excitations of ${\\rm C^+}$ and ${\\rm CO}$ by ${\\rm H}$ and ${\\rm H_2}$, respectively, are also significant contributors to the cooling of molecular clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions involving dust grains can also cool molecular clouds. This process is similar to ionic, atomic, and molecular collisions, where the lattice of the dust grain gains the excess thermal energy after the collision.  The grain then emits an IR photon that is able to escape from the cloud."

    "### The Sources of Dust Grains\n",
    "Although dust grains make up about 1% of the molecular cloud by mass, they are important constituents that help determine its chemistry and physics.  Observations indicate that dust grains can form: \n",
    "\n",
    "- in the envelopes of very cool stars aided by the enhanced density in those environments relative to molecular clouds.  On the other hand, grains can also be easily destroyed by UV and X-ray photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a product of supernova explosions and stellar winds.\n",

    "None of these sources appear able to provide the abundance of massive grains found in molecular clouds.  It appears that grains probably grow by a process of coagulation within the molecular clouds themselves."

In a certain part of the North American Nebula, the amount of interstellar extinction in the visual wavelength band is 1.1 magnitudes,  the thickness of the nebula is estimated to be 20 pc, and it is located 700 pc away from Earth.
