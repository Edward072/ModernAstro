    "## The Discovery of Sirius B\n",
    "In 1838, [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel) used the technique of stellar parallax to find the distance to the star 61 Cygni.  The next candidate Bessel tried was [Sirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), the brightest star in the sky.  It's parallax angle is $p = 0.379^{\\prime\\prime}$, which corresponds to a distance of only 2.64 pc, or 8.61 ly. Sirius' brilliance is due (in part) to its proximy to Earth.  Bessel tracked Sirius' path across the sky and found that it deviated slightly from a straight line.  Using 10 years of precise observation, Bessel concluded (in 1844) that Sirius was actually a binary star system.  He deduced that the binary orbital period was 50 years, where the modern value is $50.1284 \\pm 0.0043$ years ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)) and the position of the secondary star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bessel's telecopses were incapable of finding the \"Pup\" (i.e., the unseen companion of the luminous \"Dog Star\") due to the glare of Sirius.  After Bessel's death in 1846, the search for the Pup waned.  In 1862, [Alvan Graham Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvan_Graham_Clark) tested his father's new 18-inch refractor (3 inches longer than any previous instrument) on Sirius, and he discovered the Pup at its predicted position.  The dominant Sirius A was measured to be nearly $1000\\times$ brighter than the Pup (now called Sirius B).  The orbits of the stars about their center of mass revealed that Sirius A and Sirius B are about $2.3\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.0\\ M_\\odot$, respectively.  The modern values are $2.063 \\pm 0.023\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.018 \\pm 0.011\\ M_\\odot$ ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clark's discovery of Sirius B was made when the stars were most widely separated (by just $10^{\\prime\\prime}$) at apastron.  The great difference in their luminosities: $L_A = 25.4\\ L_\\odot$ and $L_B=0.056\\ L_\\odot$ makes observations difficult when the stars are closer together on the sky.  The next apastron comes 50 years later, where spectroscopists developed the tools to measure each star's surface temperature.  From the Pup's faint appearance, astronomers expected it to be cool and red, but they discovered that it is a hot, blue-white star that emits much of its energy in the UV.  Modern observations measure the surface temperature of Sirius B (the Pup) at $25,000 \\pm 200\\ {\\rm K}$, which is much hotter than Sirius A at $9940\\ {\\rm K}$.\n",

    "These estimated values for a white dwarf show that hydrogen must be absent from the subsurface layers because they are high enough to start fusion and the white dwarf luminosities would be several orders of magnitude larger than observed.  As a result, the interiors of white dwarfs must contain particles that are incapable of fusion at these densities and temperatures (e.g., constituents of the PP I chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "White dwarfs are born from the cores of low- and intermediate-mass stars (i.e., those with a ZAMS mass $\\lesssim 8-9\\ M_\\odot$) near the end of their lives on the AGB of the H-R diagram.  Any star with a helium core mass $\\gtrsim 0.5\\ M_\\odot$ will undergo fusion and thus, most white dwarfs consist primarily of completely ionized carbon and oxygen nuclei (i.e., the left over ${\\rm CO}$ core).  As an AGB star ages, it expels its surface layers as planetary nebula, which exposes the core as a white dwarf.  The distribution of DA white dwarf masses is sharply peaked at $0.56\\ M_\\odot$, with some 80% lying between $0.42-0.70\\ M_\\odot$.  The much larger main-sequence masses must be lost on the AGB through thermal pulses and a superwind.\n",

    "### Spectra and Surface Composition\n",
    "The exceptionally strong pull of a white dwarf's gravity is responsible for the characteristic spectrum of DA white dwarfs.  In this process, heavier nuclei are pulled below the surface while the lighter hydrogen rises to the top and results in a thin outer layer of hydrogen covering a helium layer on top of the ${\\rm CO}$ core.  This vertical stratification takes only $\\sim100$ years in the hot stellar atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the non-DA (e.g., DB and DC) white dwarfs is not yet clear.  Efficient mass-loss may occur on the AGB associated with the thermal pulse or superwind phases, which strip the white dwarf of nearly all of its hydrogen.  Alternatively, a single white dwarf may be transformed between the DA and non-DA spectral types through convective mixing.  For example, the helium convection zone's penetration into a thin hydrogen layer could change a DA into a DB white dwarf by diluting the hydrogen with additional helium. \n",

    "### Pulsating White Dwarfs\n",
    "\n",
    "White dwarfs with surface temperatures of $T_e \\approx 12,000\\ {\\rm K}$ lie within the instability strip of the H-R diagram and pulsate with periods between $100-1000\\ {\\rm s}$.  In 1968, Arlo Landolt discovered a class of variable white dwarf stars, which are known as **ZZ Ceti** variables or **DAV** stars.  The pulsation periods correspond to the nonradial *g*-modes that resonate within the white dwarf's surface layers of hydrogen and helium.  These *g*-modes involve almost perfectly horizontal displacement and thus, the radii of these compact pulsators hardly change.  Their brightness variations ($\\sim 0.1\\ {\\rm mag}$) are due to temperature variations on the stellar surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful numerical calculations of pulsating white dwarf models were carried out by [Don Winget (and others)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ARA%26A..46..157W/abstract), where they demonstrated that the *hydrogen* partial ionization zone is responsible for driving oscillations in the ZZ Ceti stars.  These computations also confirmed the elemental stratification of white dwarf envelopes.  These numerical models predict that hotter DB white dwarfs should also exhibit *g*-mode oscillations driven by the *helium* partial ionization zone.  Within a year's time from the initial prediction, it was confirmed when the first **DBV** star was discovered.  Some stars are described by their transition to the white dwarf stage as: DOV and PNNVs stars that have an effective temperature $T_e \\approx 10^5\\ {\\rm K}$.  The DO spectral type marks the initial stage of the white dwarf and the PNNV stands for planetary nebula nuclei."

A box of gas particles is filled with standing de Broglie waves that are described by three quantum numbers specifying a particle's momentum in each of three directions.

Ordinary gas has a *thermal* pressure that is related to it temperature by the ideal gas law (i.e., $PV = NkT$).  As energy ($PV$) is removed from the gas and its temperature falls, an increasingly large fraction of the particles are forced into *lower* energy states.
