    "## Basic Optics\n",
    "The development of optics greatly enhanced our window into the universe starting with Galileo's innovative use of the telescope.  Today we \"see\" with many different sets of eyes to get a fuller picture of the cosmos, discover faint objects otherwise unseen, and resolve distant objects in greater detail.  \n",

    "### Refraction and Reflection\n",
    "The first \"telescope\" was developed by Hans Lippershey in 1608 and a year later [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) built his own version with about $3\\times$ magnification and later improved upon the design to obtain a version with $30\\times$ magnification.  These **refracting** telescopes consisted of lenses through which the light would pass and form an image.  In 1671, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) showed that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colors and he developed the **reflecting** telescope that used a mirror instead of a lens to bypass the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of telescopes use a lens to produce an image, which makes a natural starting point.  [Snell's law of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) describes how the path of a light ray changes as it travels through a lens. When a wave travels across a boundary between two media, its path is bent (*refracts*) at the interface.  The amount that the ray bends is material dependent and characterized by a wavelength-dependent index of refraction $n_\\lambda = c/v_\\lambda$, where $v_\\lambda$ represents the speed of light within the medium.  Alternatively, the index of refraction indicates how much the speed of light decreases within the medium ($v_\\lambda = c/n_\\lambda$) compared to vacuum.  Note that the frequency $\\nu$ of the wave remains unchanged and the refracted wavelength must change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incoming ray possesses an angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ and the refracted ray is bent by $\\theta_r$, where both angles are measured relative to the normal to the interface.  Then Snell's law is given by\n",

    "Lens are shaped from glass so that the light rays can converge or diverge due to Snell's law.  The light rays are traced where the lens is set perpendicular to the horizontal (or **optical axis**) to produce an axis of symmetry.  *Converging* lenses force the light rays to come to a point on the optical axis (opposite from the incoming rays).  This unique point is called the **focal point** of the lens and the distance to that point from the center of the lens is called the **focal length** $f$.  By changing the curvature of the lens, the light rays can instead diverge from the optical axis to make a *diverging* lens.  As a result, the focal point lies on the *same* side as the incoming rays.  For a converging lens , the focal length is defined as positive, where the focal length is negative for a diverging lens.\n",

    "To resolve two closely spaced objects, its not simply a matter of choosing a sufficiently long focal length.  There is a fundamental limit to our ability to *resolve* the objects due to the diffraction produced by the advancing wavefronts from each object.  This phenomenon is related to the single slit diffraction pattern produced by a slit of width $D$.  Any ray passing through the opening (or **aperture**) and arriving at a specific point can be though of as being associated with another ray passing through the aperture a distance of $D/2$ away and arriving at the same point.  If the two rays are a half-wavelength ($\\lambda/2$) out of phase, then destructive interference will occur.  This leads to the relation\n",

    "### Aberrations\n",
    "Image distortions or aberrations affect both lens and mirror systems.  Refracting telescopes suffer from [chromatic aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration), which is a distortion due to the wavelength-dependent focus of a lens.  The lensmaker's formula (Eqn 2) depends on the radii of curvature and the index of refraction $n$, but $n$ also depends on the wavelength $\\lambda$.  This translates into a wavelength-dependent focal length, where the focal point for red light is different than for blue light.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be aberrations that result from the shape of the reflecting or refracting surface.  Imperfections in the grinding/polishing of lens/mirrors mean not all areas will focus a parallel set of light rays to a single point.  This type of distortion is called [spherical aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration) and can be overcome with a corrective lens.  The [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) (HST) initially had imaging problems due to spherical aberration when a mistake was made while grinding the primary and left the center of the mirror too shallow by about 2 $\\mu m$.  A repair mission in 1993, installed a special corrective optics package on the telescope.\n",

    "A **coma** produces elongated images of a point sources that lie off the optical axis. An **astigmatism** is a defect where different parts of a lens or mirror converge an image a slightly different locations on the focal plane.  Correcting for astigmatism can create other problems, such as the **curvature of field** that is due to the focusing of images on a curve rather than on a flat surface."

    "### Brightness of an Image\n",
    "It might be assumed that the brightness of an extended (resolved) image depends on the area of the aperture.  This is the case for photography, where the camera has an adjustable aperture (iris) that controls how much light enters the camera to reach the detector on the focal plane.  For most astronomical applications, the aperture is fully open because the object is effectively infinitely far away (i.e., distance $r \\gg $ focal length $f$).  Then, it can be shown that the **intensity** of the radiation is the same for both the object and image; independent of the area of the aperture.  The exception is for bright objects (e.g., the Moon), where an adjustable iris helps prevent over-exposing the image (i.e., saturation).\n",

When comparing telescopes, the amount of light collected is proportional to the area of the aperture or the illumination $J \\propto \\pi D^2/4$, where $D$ is the diameter of the telescope's aperture.  Through the plate scale (Eqn 3) we have the linear size of the image proportional to the focal length of the lens and the image area is proportional to $f^2$.  The illumination is proportional to the ratio of the aperture diameter $D$ to the focal length $f$ (i.e., $J\\propto D^2/f^2).
