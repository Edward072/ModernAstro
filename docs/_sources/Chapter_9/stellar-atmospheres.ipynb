    "## The Description of the Radiation Field\n",
    "Astronomers receive light only from the outermost layer of the star's atmosphere that overly an opaque interior.  The *temperature*, *density*, and *composition* of this layer determine the features of the star's spectrum, where we must describe how light travels through the gas to interpret the observed spectral lines properly.\n",

    "### The Specific and Mean Intensities\n",
    "Recall the [Planck function](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#the-planck-function-and-astrophysics) was based upon the wavelength-dependent flux of blackbody radiation $B_\\lambda(T)$ from an element of surface area $dA$.  A similar procedure can be used to define the intensity of a cone of light.  The light is measured in spherical coordinates by the angle $\\theta$, which is the direction perpendicular to the surface $dA$ so that $dA\\cos\\theta$ is an area projected onto a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light.  The light energy is wavelength dependent ($E = hc/\\lambda$) and thus can be defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_\\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\lambda}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_\\lambda d\\lambda$ is the energy carried by the rays in the light cone in a time interval $dt$.  The **specific intensity** of the rays is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_\\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\lambda} \\equiv \\frac{E_\\lambda d\\lambda}{d\\lambda\\:dt\\:dA \\cos\\theta\\:d\\Omega}, \\tag{1} $$\n",

    "which carries the units of energy per time per Area per steradian *sr* ([solid angle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian) or more simply, energy per everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There is a $d\\lambda$ factor in the numerator and denominator, which is a placeholder for the alternate definition of specific intensity in terms of frequency $I_\\nu$.  Recall from the [Planck function](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_3/continuous-spectrum-of-light.html#the-planck-function-and-astrophysics) using $d\\nu = -\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}d\\lambda$ as a conversion factor.\n",

    "The energy of a single light ray *does not spread out (or diverge)*, however the specific intensity $I_\\lambda$ is typically used to describe a bundle of light rays and thus varies with direction.  The **mean intensity** of the radiation is determined by integrating over all directions and normalizing the result by $4\\pi\\:{\\rm sr}$ (i.e., the solid angle enclosed by a sphere) to obtain $\\langle I_\\lambda \\rangle$, the average value of $I_\\lambda$.  In spherical coordinates, this average value is\n",

    "### The Specific Radiative Flux\n",

    "\n",
    "The specific radiative flux considers only the *z*-component (i.e., $\\cos\\theta$) of a light ray, where oppositely directed rays cancel.  Both the radiative flux and the specific intensity (Eqn. 2) describe the light received from a celestial source.  When a source is resolved by the telescope as defined by Rayleigh's criterion ($\\theta > \\theta_{\\rm min}$), the *specific intensity* is measured.  For example, the measured value of the specific intensity (at 501 nm) at the center of the Sun's disk is $I_{501} = 4.03 \\times 10^{13}\\;{\\rm W/m^{3}/sr}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For an unresolved source, the *radiative flux* is measured because the energy received from the entire source will disperse through the diffraction pattern (i.e., Airy disk and rings).  Because the light arriving at the detector leaves the source at all angles, the detector is effectively integrating the specific intensity over all directions.  As the distance to the source increases, the amount of energy falling within the Airy disk decreases as $1/r^2$, as expected.\n",

    "### Radiation Pressure\n",
    "Einstein's special theory of relativity describes photons as massless particles that nonetheless carry a momentum $p$ that is related to its energy $E$.  Thus, the photon can exert a **radiation pressure**.  Consider the gas pressure exerted by molecules bouncing off a wall, where the radiation pressure of photons can be described through a similar process. At a given time, a photon can strike a perfectly reflecting surface of area $dA$ and be reflected into a solid angle ${\\rm d}\\Omega$  (at the same angles $\\theta$ and ${\\rm d}\\Omega$ due to the law of reflection).  The change in $p_z$ of photons within a range of wavelengths from the reflection is\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of a reflecting wall, replace it with a mathematical surface $dA$ where the incident photons will now keep on going through and be streaming from the other side.  For an *isotropic radiation field*, the leading factor of 2 is removed because there is no longer a change in momentum upon reflection.  The radiation pressure becomes\n",

    "\n",
    "where the volume over all solid angles is simply a unit sphere ($4\\pi/3$).  However, for a non-isotropic radiation field the equation for the radiation pressure is still valid, but the pressure depends on the orientation of the mathematical surface $dA$.\n",
