A similar procedure can be used to define the intensity of a cone of light.  The light is measured in spherical coordinates by the angle $\\theta$, which is the direction perpendicular to the surface $dA$ so that $dA\\cos\\theta$ is an area projected onto a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light.  The light energy is wavelength dependent ($E = hc/\\lambda$) and thus can be defined as\n",

    "The specific radiative flux considers only the *z*-component (i.e., $\\cos\\theta$) of a light ray, where oppositely directed rays cancel.  Both the radiative flux and the specific intensity (Eqn. 2) describe the light received from a celestial source.  When a source is resolved by the telescope as defined by Rayleigh's criterion ($\\theta > \\theta_{\\rm min}$), the *specific intensity* is measured.  For example, the measured value of the specific intensity (at 501 nm) at the center of the Sun's disk is $I_{501} = 4.03 \\times 10^{13}\\;{\\rm W/m^{3}/sr}$.  \n",

At a given time, a photon can strike a perfectly reflecting surface of area $dA$ and be reflected into a solid angle ${\\rm d}\\Omega$  (at the same angles $\\theta$ and ${\\rm d}\\Omega$ due to the law of reflection).

    "## Stellar Opacity\n",
    "The classification of stellar spectra is complicated by the fact that stars are not actually blackbodies.  The temperature of a star's photosphere can be estimated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the spectrum shape using the Planck function.  However, the Sun's spectrum deviates substantially from the idealized shape because solar absorption lines remove light at certain wavelengths.  A dense series of metallic absorption lines in the Solar spectrum is especially effective and called **line blanketing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n",
    "There are many different measures of temperature within a star, which are defined according to a particular physical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The temperature obtained from the Stefan-Boltzmann law (**effective temperature**) is *uniquely defined for a particular layer* of the stellar atmosphere.\n",
    "- The **excitation temperature** is defined by the Boltzmann equation, which measures the ratio of atoms between two quantum states.\n",
    "- The **ionization temperature** is defined by the Saha equation, which measures the ratio of atoms that are ionized (missing electrons).\n",
    "- The **kinetic temperature** is contained in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which describes the velocity distribution of gas particles.\n",
    "- The **color temperature** is obtained by fitting the Planck function to the shape of a star's continuous spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective temperature is the only measure that depends strictly on the location within the star, while the remaining temperatures vary according to the conditions of the gas that can be described by the simple case of a gas confined within an \"ideal\" box (i.e., ideal gas law).  Due to the boundary condition of the box, the energy of the gas particles and blackbody radiation will come into equilibrium and can be described by a single well-defined temperature.  As a result, there is no net flow of energy through the box, or between the matter and radiation.  The number of photons absorbed per unit time is equal to the number of photons emitted, which is called [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium).\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a case cannot be true everywhere in a star (i.e., stars shine so some photons escape) and a star cannot be in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium.  A net outward flow of energy occurs through the star and the temperature varies with the stellar radius.  The ideal box approximation can be used: *if the distance over which the temperature changes significantly is large compared with the distances traveled by the particles and photons between collisions* (i.e., the ideal box is small enough).  The distances traveled by particles are called their *mean free paths*.  When the above condition is met, the particles and photons cannot escape the local environment and the temperature of the box is nearly constant (i.e., **local thermodynamic equilibrium** *LTE*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The photosphere is the surface layer of the Sun's atmosphere where the photons can escape into space.  The temperature in one region varies from 5580 K to 5790 K over a distance of 25.0 km.
