There are introductory guides to [Python](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Preamble/Python-basics.html) and [Markdown](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Preamble/Markdown-basics.html) in the **Preamble**.\n",

The runtime on Google Colab uses a version of Python that already has many useful packages (e.g., numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.) available with an import statement.  Each cell can be modified and executed for your curiosity.  Also, the text cells can be opened to reveal the source markup and formatting.\n",
