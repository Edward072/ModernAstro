# ASTR4410: Modern Astrophysics 
Lecture notes for ASTR4410 Modern (Stellar) Astrophysics at [Valdosta State University](https://www.valdosta.edu/phy/).  This course is designed using **An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics** by Carroll & Ostlie (2007), where it will include summaries of the course material and code implementation/exercises.  The course is divided into three sections (Introduction; Stellar Interiors & Star Formation; and Stellar Evolution & Death) that will cover 4 chapters for each section from the textbook.  In addition to homework assignments and exams, each student will give an in-class presentation using information from an instructor-assigned:

- python tutorial using astronomy

and

- a review paper from Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics

where both presentations will be assessed by both the instructor and fellow students.  The presentation using the astropy tutorials must explain to the class: how to use the relevant tools and connect to the material discussed in class.
